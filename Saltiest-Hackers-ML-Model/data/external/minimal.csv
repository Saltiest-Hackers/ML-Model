He made the point several times during proceedings that this makes it very difficult for him to see and hear the proceedings. The magistrate, Vanessa Baraitser, chose to interpret this with studied dishonesty as a problem caused by the very faint noise of demonstrators outside, as opposed to a problem caused by Assange being locked away from the court in a massive bulletproof glass box.<p>Now <i>there is no reason at all for Assange to be in that box, designed to restrain extremely physically violent terrorists.</i> He could sit, as a defendant at a hearing normally would, in the body of the court with his lawyers.

Still, the merits of each tool can be talked and discussed about.<p>&gt; you aren&#x27;t writing any SQL queries. You are creating your database schema and then launching the respective apps. Obviously some customization will be necessary since almost no app are 100% CRUD.<p>I&#x27;m not against ORMs. On the contrary, I&#x27;ve always been (and still am) looking for an ORM that takes care of 90% of queries (basic CRUD queries) while preserving the full power of SQL for the 10% of queries that require more powerful queries. Most ORMs do that part wrong and make writing custom SQL queries complex. I really want such ORM and I even tinkered and implemented one for a hobby project.<p>Also I believe that an ORM to be a wonderful combo with Wildcard, such as Prisma. (Prisma is pretty much an ORM and can be used without GraphQL.) I would argue that Prisma + Wildcard to be superior to Prisma + GraphQL. (With the exception of when you need need third-party devS to access your data -- you then need a generic API with either REST or GraphQL.)<p>&gt; But I took a look at your RPC tool, and it adds a lot of boilerplate work.<p>I couldn&#x27;t disagree more; Wildcard is deliberately designed to abstract away as much boilerplate as possible. I&#x27;d be more than happy to see a concrete example that proves me wrong. My guess is that you won&#x27;t prove such example because there virtually isn&#x27;t such.<p>&gt; This RPC boilerplate is exactly why alternatives like Hasura, Prisma, and Postgraphile exist.<p>That&#x27;s a vague sentence and doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me.<p>&gt; it is just as simple, just as much a layer on top of the database.<p>Wildcard is only a couple of KLOCs while Hasura &amp; co large and complex tools developed by teams and backend by big VC money.<p>You can read Wildcard&#x27;s whole documentation in 10 minutes. Reading Hasura&#x27;s entire documentation is <i>much</i> larger than Wildcard&#x27;s.<p>It speaks volumes about how much simpler Wildcard is in comparison to Hasura.<p>It&#x27;s weird to say that Hasura is as simple as Wildcard.<p>&gt; the client doesn&#x27;t have to know if it&#x27;s talking to a relational database, a Redis cache, a REST data server, an in-memory data model, or whatever.<p>Such decoupling is mostly useful for very large projects. The vast majority of apps out there don&#x27;t need such decoupling. Separation of concern is important, but based on <i>concern</i> not on technology.<p>&gt; Your tool on the other hand is just another vendor-specific ORM or manual query engine.<p>It&#x27;s weird to call an RPC implementation an &quot;ORM&quot; or &quot;query engine&quot;. I&#x27;m not sure how an Software Engineer is able to mix up &quot;RPC&quot; with &quot;ORM&quot;.<p>Honestly, your whole post is weird to me, I&#x27;m not sure what your motive is. You seem to try to put down an open source project that is being developed by someone in his free time and without any remuneration. That&#x27;s disgusting and without taste. If you only have a lack of tact then I apologize for my words.<p>Just to be clear I do like many aspects of Hasura. The problem is that, 95% of the time, GraphQL is not being used in the right situations. GraphQL when used correctly is a lovely tool. (Basically GraphQL = generic API for third parties. If you don&#x27;t need third parties to access your data then you don&#x27;t need GraphQL.)",,

22445720,zahllos,1582919359,22434398,"What the parent commenter meant, I believe, is that the UK Supreme Court is a new construct. Previously, the court of last resort (for cases like this at least) was the House of Lords, specifically those members known as the &quot;law lords&quot; or as their reply indicates, more formally the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary.<p>All current Supreme Court justices were drawn from the Law Lords and as a consequence of being Lords cannot vote for MPs. However, so far as I am aware, there&#x27;s no requirement for a Supreme Court justice to be a Lord and thus no guarantee that any future Supreme court justice will be unable to vote for MPs.<p>What we may be witnessing, however, is more unspoken convention being established (that Supreme Court justices are made peers on appointment or shortly thereafter).<p>All that said, the UK Civil Service has a policy of neutrality. Civil servants are divided into junior and senior, depending on the role (not on age or length of service). Junior civil servants are discouraged from political commentary and being &quot;card-carrying&quot; party members and in particular holding any office in a political party. Senior civil servants are outright forbidden to be officers of political parties and any kind of public expression of views is also strictly forbidden.<p>This is because unlike the US, where the administration changes with the incoming party, the civil service remains unchanged and simply serves the incoming government.<p>The Judiciary in the UK are not technically civil servants, they&#x27;re subject to similar restrictions. You can find the evidence of that here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.judiciary.uk&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;Guide-to-Judicial-Conduct-March-2019.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.judiciary.uk&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;Guide-to...</a>, specifically: &quot;There is a statutory prohibition on salaried judges undertaking any kind of political activity or
having ties with a political party&quot;. This extends to public demonstrations of any kind, and further extends to spouses of judges and close relatives as well.<p>So, even if a future Supreme Court Justice is not a lord, having any kind of political view that is publicly known is unlikely to be compatible with their appointment. This extends to judges. Unless the judge is a lord (and so restricted from appointing to the commons) they are allowed their own private views, and of course may vote (the same is true of the civil service) - but their public conduct is held to a standard of impartiality.<p>For further information, see this article <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;law&#x2F;2012&#x2F;mar&#x2F;28&#x2F;select-committee-seeks-diverse-judiciary"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;law&#x2F;2012&#x2F;mar&#x2F;28&#x2F;select-committee...</a> on rejecting confirmation hearings by parliament and Lady Hale&#x27;s speech on standing down as the head of the Supreme Court after the brexit&#x2F;impartiality mess: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;law&#x2F;2019&#x2F;dec&#x2F;18&#x2F;lady-hale-warns-uk-not-to-select-top-judges-on-basis-of-political-views"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;law&#x2F;2019&#x2F;dec&#x2F;18&#x2F;lady-hale-warns-...</a> .

The Queen always acts on advice from ministers, even when that advice was illegal (see brexit) and even if she suspects it to be so. This is because the Queen strictly does not interfere with politics, ever (in private, she may however call the Prime Minister an utter moron, to his or her face, repeatedly for the duration of their weekly meeting, if she so chose. It&#x27;s also legally required for ministers to inform her of what is going on in government, hence the despatch boxes).<p>As above, I&#x27;m not sure the requirement for being a Lord will necessarily hold for the Supreme Court. It does not appear to be in the legislation. The process is detailed on wikipedia: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Justice_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_Kingdom#Appointment"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Justice_of_the_Supreme_Court_o...</a> and involves the Judiciary selecting a candidate and passing that name to the prime minister, who is legally required to pass that name on to the Queen.<p>The most the political part of this process can do is ask for reconsideration. The judiciary may then submit a different name, or submit the same name again. In the event they do the latter it must be accepted. In the event they do the former, the Lord Chancellor may still chose the first name.<p>In summary: in the UK system, judges are far more independent of politics than in the US system.",,

Nobody knows who invented hay, the idea of cutting grass in the autumn and storing it in large enough quantities to keep horses and cows alive through the winter. All we know is that the technology of hay was unknown to the Roman Empire but was known to every village of medieval Europe. Like many other crucially important technologies, hay emerged anonymously during the so-called Dark Ages. According to the Hay Theory of History, the invention of hay was the decisive event which moved the center of gravity of urban civilization from the Mediterranean basin to Northern and Western Europe. The Roman Empire did not need hay because in a Mediterranean climate the grass grows well enough in winter for animals to graze. North of the Alps, great cities dependent on horses and oxen for motive power could not exist without hay. So it was hay that allowed populations to grow and civilizations to flourish among the forests of Northern Europe.

22445999,DiogenesKynikos,1582921546,22442670,"There are several important reasons why Galileo found Copernicus&#x27; heliocentrism more compelling than Ptolemy&#x27;s geocentrism.<p>First off, you have to understand the intellectual background. Aristotelian physics dominated Europe at the time. Aristotle held the Earth to be separate from the heavens, with the heavens being the realm of perfect forms. All imperfect objects seek to move to the center of the Universe, which is the center of the Earth, while perfect objects move in circles in the heavens. This was the intellectual foundation of geocentrism.<p>Galileo was the first human in history to point a telescope at the sky, and what he saw fundamentally undermined Aristotelian physics. The Moon is not a perfect form: it has mountains, just like the Earth. Not everything revolves around the Earth: Jupiter has its own moons that orbit it. The Sun is also not perfect: it has spots. Galileo also did mechanical experiments that demonstrated the principle of inertia (Newton&#x27;s first law), which further undermined Aristotelian physics. With Aristotelian physics out the window, the strong intellectual bias towards geocentrism was also gone. Until Galileo&#x27;s telescopic observations, he himself had been a geocentrist, like most people.<p>If you then look at geocentrism and heliocentrism with fresh eyes, there are a lot of appealing aspects of heliocentrism.<p>* Geocentrism needs epicycles to explain even the most basic elements of planetary motion (retrograde motion). Heliocentrism already explains retrograde motion without any epicycles. Not only that, but heliocentrism correctly predicts exactly where (in relation to the Sun) retrograde motion occurs. In the geocentric model, retrograde motion could occur anywhere, but in the heliocentric model, it has to occur when planets are opposite the Sun, and lo and behold, that&#x27;s exactly where it occurs.<p>* The Jovian system and the Earth-Moon system also suggest that small objects orbit larger objects, according to some as-of-yet (at Galileo&#x27;s time) undiscovered principle. Why would the Sun (which was then known to be much larger than the Earth) orbit the Earth?<p>* The phases of Venus decisively rule out Ptolemy&#x27;s model. In order to save geocentrism, you have to invent some weird geo-heliocentric hybrid model (Tycho&#x27;s model). To many people, a pure heliocentric model was much more appealing, and the hybrid model appeared to be an awkward attempt to save some of geocentrism.",,

So when I login via Google, both the consumption of my username &#x2F; password to produce the ID Token JWT, <i>and</i> the consumption of the ID Token by the third-party are authentication.<p>&gt; For example, a user signs in and gets a JWT token that has the permission Delete.Everything which in this example is the permission required to delete all a users resources, the client takes this and passes it to the backed.<p>This is again confusing a common use case of JWT with what it actually is. A JWT is just a signed token. The concept of a &#x27;permission&#x27; used here is an abstraction upon what JWT really defines, which are &#x27;claims&#x27; (i.e. signed information).<p>&gt; On the backend however, the user might not even be allowed to delete everything. Maybe they&#x27;re under investigation, or maybe this particular service just doesn&#x27;t allow it. But its not the role of the JWT to tell you whether or not this particular user is allowed to perform that action,
all the JWT token tells you is that this user has allowed the bearer of the JWT token to perform that action on their behalf.<p>This is a usage detail for which there are several valid approaches. It&#x27;s not uncommon to see a JWT used as an authentication token <i>be</i> the source of truth, with only invalidation based on unique id (jti).<p>The concept of the JWT being correlated with a user authorization is an entirely synthetic one. It&#x27;s a common use case. Check the original RFC.<p>&gt; But, doesn&#x27;t mean the user is allowed to perform that action to begin with, so the user has given the client permission to perform an action they themselves aren&#x27;t allowed to perform.<p>Consider this counterpoint: if the JWT itself is not itself a statement of authorization, what&#x27;s the point in signing it at all? We could just be sending a unique id corresponding to this token (like a circa 200x OAuth token) and get the same effect. JWT is used for a common pattern, but it&#x27;s important to understand why that pattern is chosen.",,

I bought two of them that have USB 3.1 Gen 2 UASP interfaces and filled them with shucked 12TB disks. They&#x27;re attached to the NUC using regular A-&gt;C USB 3.1 Gen 2 cables while the Thunderbolt port is connected to a Thunderbolt -&gt; 10GbE adapter.

Climate science was not his speciality, and he was humble about his relation to it and quick to point out that there are people more familiar with the current state of the field than him, but he was involved in important early climate studies. From Wikipedia:<p>&gt; Around 1979 Dyson worked with the Institute for Energy Analysis on climate studies. This group, under Alvin Weinberg&#x27;s direction, pioneered multidisciplinary climate studies, including a strong biology group. Also during the 1970s, Dyson worked on climate studies conducted by the JASON defense advisory group.<p>There have been lots of advances in modelling complex systems, but it’s notoriously difficult to find models that work beyond a short timeframe. Dumb simple models often work better than cutting edge, complicated, much more realistic ones simply because there are less variables to get wrong. And every time you make an advance, the assumed accuracy of the model’s long term predictions needs to be reset: if model A predicted 1 year accurately, and you improved it so model A.1 predicted the next year accurately, you don’t have a model that accurately predicted 2 years; there is still only 1 unknown year that was predicted, and A.1 was just as accurate&#x2F;inaccurate as model A at predicting that unknown year whether or not it took that past year into account.<p>We’ve seen how easy it is for sophisticated and complex models of chaotic systems like the stock market to fail despite people’s faith in them. His point seems as prudent now as back then; I think some systems are a lot more complicated than we’d like, and that we should have enough hubris to acknowledge that and be constantly testing our assumptions against empirical data.<p>He didn’t dismiss the value of models in helping understand chaotic systems, he was just wary about their long term predictions.

They never ask for something specific. I believe if you ask for specific things you want - like ask someone if they can buy you a shirt to help you get a job, you will find someone that will do it.

22446459,Pfhreak,1582924676,22446259,"Glad you asked. The problem is partly because housing is a commodity. Everyone from the developers to the banks have the incentive to build the most luxury unit they can sell -- developer gets more rents&#x2F;sales, bank considers units less risky, etc.<p>There is a pressing and urgent need for more housing, but there is also a huge eviction crisis in those same cities.<p>So what can we do?<p><i></i>Public housing&#x2F;Public funding for housing<i></i> -- fund both capital and operations publicly, paying developers more to incentivize building non-luxury units.<p><i></i>Tax empty units<i></i> -- Taxing units that are empty reduces speculation in homes. It should not be financially possible to buy housing and leave it empty as a way to store value.<p><i></i>Rent Control<i></i> -- Limiting rent increases tenant control over a neighborhood, limiting the amount of speculation and acting like a bit of a brake on market rate.<p><i></i>Build More<i></i> -- Upzoning, especially with regulations that require more units per lot and require moving tenants to equivalent units while construction is ongoing. It&#x27;s no good to tear down a bunch of townhouses and put in an apartment building with the same number of units.<p><i></i>Eliminate minimum parking<i></i> -- Parking takes a massive amount of space. Especially in an urban core. Use that space for housing people not cars.<p><i></i>Decommodify Housing<i></i> -- Make it <i>less</i> profitable to be a landlord. Give tenants right of first refusal in the sale of their buildings, form housing coops, guarantee tenants representation in legal battles, create stricter laws around evictions. If it&#x27;s less appealing to treat housing like a commodity, it&#x27;s easier to push for housing as a right. All of these things are about making small chips away from the power of landlords to extract rents.<p><i></i>Affordable Foreclosure Insurance<i></i> -- Insurance helps ensure people can stay in their homes, upkeep their homes, and continue to contribute to the neighborhood. Reduces the amount of home flipping pushing prices upwards.<p><i></i>Community Land Trusts<i></i> -- There are groups that buy land&#x2F;houses and sell&#x2F;rent them at below market rates (with the rider that the property must be sold later at below market rates.) In Seattle, for example: <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.homesteadclt.org&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.homesteadclt.org&#x2F;</a> By putting downward pressure on market rates, you further decommodify housing and make it easier to push for reforms that make the ROI better for housing more people rather than more luxuriously.<p><i></i>Stiffer Penalties for failing to upkeep apartments<i></i> -- When apartments fall into disrepair, whole buildings need to be taken offline or people refuse to live there. Requiring high standards in maintaining apartments ensures that the housing we <i>do</i> have doesn&#x27;t get taken out of circulation too early.<p>Edit: I&#x27;m assuming you asked in good faith. I don&#x27;t think we need to do all of the above. I don&#x27;t think we can do all of the above right away.

Storage is cheap, but the labor that goes into managing the longevity of datasets isn&#x27;t: it&#x27;s essentially continually keeping your infrastructure up-to-date whilst also ensuring the integrity and readability of the datasets as was intended when they were first created. It implies regular checks of bit integrity, readability of your data, checking that you can restore your data, ensuring that you can access the data, making sure that you can find the data and everything is catalogued, ensuring that you have the rights and license to use the data,...<p>When it comes to physical archives of the past, you have to be aware of your own survivorship bias. We only have an idea of what is preserved to the extent that documents are archived, recorded and thus discoverable.<p>What we do not know is how much knowledge and information was lost to the past. When you look at documents, you&#x27;re always limited to what&#x27;s there. And when you hit the boundaries of what&#x27;s there, then you may have indications that there was far more in the past, but you have to conclude: sadly that&#x27;s lost. Either because it is physically lost, or because it might be somewhere in the archive but it&#x27;s not registered yet in a catalogue and therefor not accessible.<p>That&#x27;s why I think that making backups with &quot;barely a thought&quot; is only as effective as to the extent to which you have organized your data, used accessible &#x2F; readable data formats and filesystems.<p>For instance, most people these days generate endless streams of photos with their digital devices, which then get automagically uploaded to cloud services. And that&#x27;s great. The downside of that is that your ability to find a specific picture from 5 years ago is entirely restricted to the extent that you were able to organize and add specific metadata to that picture. Let alone, if you did take the opportunity to do so.<p>That&#x27;s why I advise people to sit down, and take time to go through their digital albums to pick the nicest or most important pictures they have, print them out on quality photo paper in several copies and store them with labels in albums at different physical locations.<p>When it comes to longevity, your physical albums will still be accessible to your descendants some 70 or 100 years down the line. Something that isn&#x27;t remotely guaranteed by cloud solutions.<p>And that&#x27;s just photos. Consider e-mail or the countless of closed messaging apps you have been using these past years.

Avoid flexing the disc, exposing it to direct sunlight, excessive heat and&#x2F;or humidity, handle it only when being used and do not eat, drink and smoke near it. Discs should be stored in jewel cases rather than sleeves as cases do not contact the discs’ surfaces and generally provide better protection again scratches, dust, light and rapid humidity changes. Once placed in their cases discs can be further protected by keeping them in a closed box, drawer or cabinet. For long-term storage and archival situations it is advisable to follow manufacturer instructions.

Almost nobody is familiar with Statium yet, it&#x27;s very new. :) It was developed for cloud applications UI here at DataStax.<p>Statium implements a very simple key&#x2F;value storage in a React component called ViewModel. It is using `setState()` internally, so all the usual React rendering logic applies unchanged. Each ViewModel has access to keys of its ancestors, all the way up the chain. There is no global store but a chain of stores instead, which helps to keep state local to consumer components that use it.<p>Urlito is just a simple library for persisting state to and from URI, currently using query params. This is intended for local component state like selected tab, sort order in a table, or a list of expanded rows in a tree grid, the sort of things that do not deserve full blown URI routing pattern matching. We still use `react-router-dom` for that.<p>&gt; How does changing the URL trigger a state change? Does the whole page need to reload?<p>No, it&#x27;s the usual React logic: when ViewModel renders it will call the function provided in `initialState` prop, which in turn will read the current state of the model from URI query string. Whenever ViewModel state changes, `observeStateChange` function is called, and updates URI to reflect the current model state.<p>Urlito implements the functions for reading keys&#x2F;values from URI and writing them back to URI, with support for default values and key filtering.<p>&gt; In my system, my &quot;Reader&quot; knows this object so it can just call the regular setState (I also have some mount&#x2F;umount logic there to avoid leaking memory). This makes back&#x2F;forward transitions very snappy!<p>Almost the same solution in Statium, except that we have a full blown class based React component to hold the state, and hooks are not used internally (there is a hook based consumer API). The main reason for not using hooks for us is that the values held in `useState` are hard to propagate down the component tree, and hard to test. ViewModel takes care of this easily, with each key available anywhere downstream, e.g. a Component somewhere deep can retrieve the value of the topmost ViewModel without having to access it directly. This helps mightily with testing too: just wrap your tested components with a ViewModel and pass whatever you want to it (including state changes).<p>No memory leak issues at all, since a ViewModel is simply a React component that outsources `this.setState` for consumer components. :)<p>Transitions are very snappy with Statium, too. In fact, state updates are lighting fast: value updater function will walk up the ViewModel tree, find the closest owner and set the value in it using `setState`. This will cause the owner ViewModel and its children to re-render, but the render will be automatically scoped to the least amount of components. Since the state is usually localized, the problem of updating the whole app state on a keypress does not apply by default.<p>&gt; I can also use the same logic for my Server (another &quot;Persistor&quot; [sic]) which indeed uses POST for submitting updates, but responses come down a shared SSE stream (which I need anyway so that users can see eachothers changes in real-time).<p>Asynchronous logic is hard to handle in synchronous React rendering paradigm... That was the reason for me to come up with a ViewController concept (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;riptano&#x2F;statium#viewcontroller"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;riptano&#x2F;statium#viewcontroller</a>), which is the other part of Statium. The idea is to write business logic in a more imperative style, statements not functions:<p><pre><code>    const loadUserPosts = async ({ $get, $set }) =&gt; {
        let [user, posts, comments] = $get(&#x27;user&#x27;, &#x27;posts&#x27;, &#x27;comments&#x27;);
    
        if (!posts) {
            await $set({ loading: true });
        
            posts = await loadPosts(user);
        
            await $set({ loading: false, posts });
        }
    
        if (!comments) {
            await $set({ loading: true });
        
            comments = await loadComments(user, posts);
        
            await $set({ loading: false, comments });
        }
    };
</code></pre>
Decyphering this: $get is a function that returns ViewModel state values by keys, and $set allows updating these values. This is a matter of personal preference of course, but I think this approach makes the logic much easier to read and understand than Redux thunks or sagas.<p>There&#x27;s also the RealWorld example app I came up with for React + Statium, check it out: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nohuhu&#x2F;react-statium-realworld-example-app"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nohuhu&#x2F;react-statium-realworld-example-ap...</a>.

<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;rgaTLrZGlk0"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;rgaTLrZGlk0</a><p>&quot;Learn music theory in half an hour&quot; is obviously an exaggeration, but it really comes astoundingly close to fulfilling that promise. It contains a lot of information and each part builds on the previous parts, so it requires focus and maybe a few repetitions to &#x27;get it&#x27;, but I think the approach is fantastic for showing how many ideas of music theory are deeply connected.<p>Not a book as you requested, but hopefully you&#x27;ll find the other reply useful. As for some of your specific questions:<p>Frequency is the same concept as radio frequency, but in this case refers to something we can directly sense. Radios transmit electromagnetic waves, which are photons moving at a certain rate, measured in Hertz, or cycles per second. Sound frequency refers to movement of air waves, so a more accurate analogy than radio waves is waves in a pond when a rock is thrown in. Human ears are sensitive to frequencies between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz, so any sound you hear is a combination of frequencies. Natural language is helpful here, since higher frequencies sound &#x27;higher&#x27; and lower frequencies sound &#x27;lower&#x27;.<p>A tone is a sound at a specific frequency, also known as a note. For example, 440 Hz is designated as the note A4 by the Geneva conventions, and this is what most instrument tunings are based off.<p>Twelve tone equal temperament is the tuning system nearly all modern Western music uses. Certain ratios of frequencies sound pleasant, especially ratios with small numbers, such as 1:2, 2:3, and 3:4. So if we know 440 Hz is a note in the system, it would be nice to also have 587 Hz, 660 Hz, and 880 Hz. However, these frequencies will only really sound good when played with that original 440 Hz, not necessarily with each other. So instead of using them exactly, we approximate them in a useful way. The 1:2 ratio, the octave, is generally considered to be the most important, so that ratio is kept, but otherwise the notes are equally spaced (human hearing is logarithmic), or equally tempered. The most popular tuning system has twelve tones. There&#x27;s no note at 660 Hz, but there&#x27;s one at 659 Hz, which is pretty close, and there happens to be one at 587 Hz. Other ratios are also represented reasonably well.<p>A key is a collection of notes that sound good together, based on the ratios of their frequencies. The alternative would be chromatic composition, where all 12 notes are used and none is obviously &#x27;more important&#x27;. Most music is in a specific key, but uses some chromatic notes to make the melody more interesting.",[22447471],

The kernel&#x27;s notion of high memory, instead, is a software construct, not directly driven by the hardware.</i><p>This is indeed a great write-up. Some old lessons I had forgotten:<p>Physical memory needs to be mapped by a kernel data structure. As typical DRAM configurations grew, this map itself necessarily became large enough to limit the 1GB dedicated to kernel on 32-bit systems. So a subset was directly mapped, and the rest -- the &quot;high memory&quot; -- was mapped by a secondary structure.<p>If I&#x27;m reading this right.",,

When you do anything outside the box CRPGs just break, while a good game master will run with it and that&#x27;s how the best stories happen. We found a boss we didn&#x27;t wanted to fight. Our spellcasters decided sending a construct with 2 bags of holding to put one into another near the boss will destroy it. It worked, but it also created portal to another dimension, and when we tried to recover the hostages 2 player characters got thrown into that dimension. The rest of the party had to pay a powerful mage to recover them with our best magical weapon. Half a session (several hours) was spent arguing over who owns the magical weapon and if it&#x27;s good idea to give it away :) They almost fought in game :) Meanwhile my character stranded in another dimension decided to become a priest (I was a barbarian before).<p>These kind of stuff never happens in CRPGs - it couldn&#x27;t because there&#x27;s infinite number of possible open-ended solutions to any problem.

The most important advantage is that you can play with people from other continent, so it&#x27;s much easier to find players. But the computer-assisted part is also making the rules much less of a problem. You set up your character (all the items, feats, skills, abilities) before the game, and when DM wants he asks you to roll the attack, you click and the system rolls the dices for everybody to see, adds the needed modifiers, calculates the damage (including critical hit if needed etc. ) and shows how much hitpoints you lost.<p>It&#x27;s faster than doing all this stuff physically and beyond the initial setup and occasional level-up it makes complicated rules more bearable.",,

After I finally hit the leader board, I became extremely uncomfortable with continuing to use that handle.<p>I felt there were too many eyes on me and if I needed to explain it, it wasn&#x27;t a good handle under which to have that kind of visibility.

There&#x27;s scoping (where rust will copy across scope boundaries for non-ref types, which allows closing over something as in your first example above).<p>Then there&#x27;s mutable refs and mutable variables, which as hope-striker mentioned I was confusing, possibly because I was using ints in my example. If instead we used a vec:<p><pre><code>    fn main() {
     let x = vec![0,1,2]
     x.push(3) &#x2F;&#x2F; fails since x isn&#x27;t mutable
    }
</code></pre>
There&#x27;s no clear direct related concept here by default. If we&#x27;re allowed to use pytype, you get this:<p><pre><code>    def main():
      x: Sequence[int] = [1,2,3]  # Sequences aren&#x27;t mutable
      x.push(3)  # fails since x isn&#x27;t mutable
</code></pre>
Cool, so mutable and immutable values are possible in both langs. What about refs? Well we went through that one, if you pass a mutable ref to a function in rust, you can modify the ref in ways that just aren&#x27;t possible in python:<p><pre><code>    fn main() {
        println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
        let mut x: i32 = 3;
        modifies(&amp;mut x);
        println!(&quot;{}&quot;, x);
    }

    fn modifies(x: &amp;mut i32) {
        *x = 5;
    }
</code></pre>
There&#x27;s nothing analogous to this in python. Everything is always passed as a mutable &quot;value&quot;[1], nothing is passed as a ref.<p>Cool so that&#x27;s mutable variables and mutable references. That leaves this weird scoping issue. In rust (and in cpp) there&#x27;s lots of scopes. Any set of braces creates a new scope, and so shadowing can happen across scopes. Lambda capture&#x2F;closure happens over the scope. A given scope binds a name to a value, or a set of names to their values.<p>Python&#x27;s a bit different, only new names are created in the scope. If a name isn&#x27;t accessible in the given scope, the name is pulled from parent scopes etc.<p>So for the capturing behavior you want, there&#x27;s weird nonlocal stuff that needs to be done, or you can explicitly make an additional scope, which removes the wonky behavior. If the name were really mutable, you&#x27;d be able to change what x referred to in the enclosing scope, which you can&#x27;t.<p>tl;dr: This isn&#x27;t mutable names, its python&#x27;s (admittedly abnormal) scoping rules.<p>[1]: Unless you add in mypy or whatnot, where the typechecker will prevent you from modifying something that is non-mutable, but unlike in rust this isn&#x27;t done with mutability as a first class citizen, its just that some interfaces expose mutating methods (`append`) and some don&#x27;t.

And even less likely in either case if you&#x27;re currently healthy.<p>There isn&#x27;t much reason to be concerned about quarantines either. The point of a quarantine is to limit the spread of the virus. When there are only a small number of cases, using extraordinary quarantine measures is justified because there is the potential to stamp it out entirely. If too many people get infected, there is no longer any hope of that and continuing the extraordinary measures is impractical. You shut down an airport when a city is infected, you don&#x27;t shut down every airport when every city is infected. So if it spreads, you fall back to the ordinary measures. Wash your hands, if you get sick go to the doctor and not to work, get vaccinated once they have a vaccine etc. It&#x27;s not good but the world doesn&#x27;t shut down.<p>Around 10% of people get the flu every year. If this is equally severe but more contagious, maybe it&#x27;s twice as bad, or five times as bad. It seems pretty implausible that it could be much more than ten times as bad.<p>An advantage we have here is that February is over. Flu season is ending rather than beginning in the northern hemisphere (and it&#x27;s still several months off in the southern hemisphere).

He was so amazing I can&#x27;t even describe it. I didn’t look at my watch once during the speech. Not long into the talk, the elderly gentleman next to me pulled a scrap of paper out of his pocket and began scribbling notes. He kept writing until the end of the speech. I glanced behind me during the question-and-answer period, and noticed that Schwartz Auditorium was so full that people were standing in the balcony and sitting on the railings just to hear Dyson.<p>The text of Dyson’s speech would have impressed any English teacher. He structured it as seven short stories, with each one slowly building on each other. The style of his writing––the way he chose his words and structured his sentences––would have been impressive if he had been giving a lecture in the humanities, much less a field stereotyped for less-able communicators. The way Dyson was able to convey the sheer wonder of science was an orgasmic experience equivalent to reading my first Carl Sagan book.<p>An 80-year-old physicist who had the energy of a young assistant professor, who delivered his speech fluidly and responded deftly to the audience’s questions––a scientist proficient in more than one science, and fluent enough in biology to give an entire lecture on biotechnology!!!!

It just isn&#x27;t what is desired in the standard library. &quot;What is desirable in the standard library&quot; is a very exclusive list.<p>This sounds like a reasonable argument if your language is, say, Julia, or something like Lua, where in the first case you probably don&#x27;t write code that needs to do a lot of work at the OS&#x2F;network&#x2F;hardware level, i.e. <i>systems programming</i>, and in the second case, the language has a <i>good</i> built in FFI that lets you drop down into C or a similar language to do systems programming. Python, Clojure and Ruby fit more-or-less into the second case. C simply forces you to do all of the work yourself.<p>But Go&#x27;s FFI (cgo) is a constant source of consternation, and while Go&#x27;s authors admit it might not be suitable for &quot;the largest&quot; codebases, the hostility of Go to good FFI makes it more uncomfortable to use in practice. The official viewpoint is something to the effect of &quot;most people shouldn&#x27;t need cgo&quot;.

They would make some fundamentally flawed argument, get shot down, and so they would move on to other arguments, which is not great but valid. But then, later, I&#x27;d see them making the <i>exact same argument</i> to someone else.<p>To people like this, arguing is like punching. If you punch someone and they get up, they&#x27;re a &quot;tough opponent&quot;. That doesn&#x27;t mean that punching is ineffective on other people. They just <i>don&#x27;t understand</i> at their core that once an argument is shown to be false, it can <i>never</i> be reused. Their mind just doesn&#x27;t work this way. They think &quot;Well, left-hook didn&#x27;t work on <i>this</i> guy, but maybe it&#x27;ll work in <i>that</i> guy&quot; or &quot;This guy didn&#x27;t fall for this argument, but maybe that guy will.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s deeply dishonest, but I&#x27;m not convinced they&#x27;re even aware of this.<p>So, just from a cursory look at his code, the glaring problems I see are:<p>1) It&#x27;ll crash if you feed it more than 256MB because of the way the C# BitArray class works. He&#x27;s also using 32-bit ints in several places that have similar issues. These are implementation details, but it just goes to show how thoughtless the &quot;reference implementation&quot; is.<p>2) Similarly, the reference implementation copies the entire data into the BitArrary (and then back into a byte array) for each &quot;round&quot;. This is <i>spectacularly</i> inefficient. He never mentions throughput in terms of MB&#x2F;s&#x2F;GHz or any such thing. I wonder why...<p>3) It&#x27;s not a stream cipher. You need to encrypt the entire file. Again, he could come up with some sort of streaming version by feeding in the last few KB of the previous encrypted chunk into the next chunk, but he hasn&#x27;t. As the long history of various streaming ciphers have shown, this is actually a hard problem to solve efficiently <i>and</i> securely. This is why AES-GCM is the hot new thing: it&#x27;s both.<p>4) If <i>either</i> the key or salt values are all 0s then the encryption does <i>nothing</i>. AES for comparison will still encrypt your data with <i>some</i> level of security even if the IV initialisation is not perfectly random or skipped.<p>5) He&#x27;s calculating the offsets as an &quot;int&quot; from a byte multiplied by a byte. Hence the maximum shift is 65536 positions. This is just big enough to exceed L1 data cache on most platforms, but have a high hit ratio. Whether you hit the L1 cache or not depends on the Key &amp; IV values, so this is a recipe for timing-based side-channel attacks. Constant-time cyphers are basically mandatory these days...<p>6) Related to the above: The bit shifts are only in an 8KB window, but the byte shifts are in an 64KB window. I wonder if there&#x27;s some interaction here where this might make some keys insecure.<p>7) Despite this windowing, the default &quot;protocol&quot; wraps around the end of the file to the beginning using a modulo the data.Length, so it can&#x27;t be used as a streaming cipher. To do so, he&#x27;d have to introduce a breaking change.<p>8) The encryption is defined in terms of bit-by-bit and byte-by-byte <i>long-range</i> operations, so there&#x27;s basically no hope of ever making this efficient. E.g.: with SIMD or similar many-bytes-at-a-time instruction sets. The &quot;state&quot; that would have to be kept in CPU registers is over 64KB, so this is just never, ever, <i>EVER</i> going to compete with something like AES-NI.<p>I could go on, but I&#x27;m wasting my time.

It has nothing to do with exclusivity and everything to do with verification.<p>In this case they could admit the current system is broken and retire it completely (until they come up with a better solution). They don&#x27;t, and just make up BS reasons to buy time because it turns out the system as it currently stands is good for them. The exclusivity (even more so now that the system is supposedly on hold, so you can&#x27;t apply for verification as a layman even if you do meet the criteria like being impersonated, etc) is a <i>feature</i> that Twitter wants to preserve without admitting it.<p>&gt; There are established KYC processes followed by every serious company, like a bank.<p>Banks&#x27; KYC processes operate within a way narrower set of constraints than a social network:<p>* They are usually limited to the local country, so the main process only have to support the most common forms of ID available in the area (edge-cases such as foreigners can go through a fallback, more manual process). A social network will on the other hand need to support every single possible form of ID.<p>* The bank can invest much more money into the verification process than a social network which would be lucky to make a few bucks a month per user.<p>* Conventional banks use physical branches to open accounts, so it raises the risk for a potential attacker as they would now need to show up <i>in person</i> with their fake ID and the fake document has to match their looks. This significantly raises the cost of the attack and the potential risk the attacker incurs in carrying it out. Social networks can&#x27;t do this.<p>* Even for online banks where you can open an account online, you at least need to provide a mailing address to receive the card associated with the account so you can spend the money. So while you might indeed be able to trick an online bank into opening you an account with a fake ID, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to <i>use</i> it until you somehow collect the card. This again significantly raises the cost of the attack and requires the attacker to be local (or have an accomplice) and take more risk than a fully online attack carried out from behind an anonymization service such as Tor.<p>&gt; as you could only sell your ID once<p>There&#x27;s a ton of people out there that have never even heard of the social network, couldn&#x27;t care less about it, but would be happy to get some $$$ in exchange of something that is very unlikely to affect them directly (if they don&#x27;t use the social network they most likely wouldn&#x27;t even know or care about their identity&#x27;s reputation on it). The potential stigma associated with loaning your account will become less of an issue if the practice becomes mainstream and everyone is doing it. In fact I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s already mainstream in the form of being an &quot;influencer&quot;, and a lot of people, especially younger ones <i>want</i> to be one.

And in the event biometrics are used in a physical location (which I’m not personally a fan of, but let’s consider it anyway), there’s often also a human there as well. Your clever mask may fool the sensor, but it probably also still looks like a mask to the guard behind the desk.",,

That always creates a &quot;hollowing out&quot; of its core over time as users exceed the capacities of its standard library and try to push it into new environments. In contrast, Lua, for example, has a parasitic quality to it: make the host more powerful and then you can easily give Lua similar powers.<p>However, the other half of that is that in a lot of cases, the libraries are chosen, not the language. And then why would you choose the janky &quot;worse is better&quot; libraries? Well, there is a reason: at some level all your code is still a prototype or draft and the &quot;real thing&quot; is yet to come. And then Go looks rather successful on that front in that its primitivism works at the outset and ships a lot of software, which in turn creates the demand for the heavier &quot;big-boy&quot; solutions.<p>That&#x27;s a thing I often don&#x27;t see addressed in this kind of rant.",,

If browsers had strictly enforced HTML syntax from the beginning, noone would ever have built websites with &quot;little issues in the markup&quot;.<p>Thats not reality, if everyone got perfect formed input we wouldn&#x27;t be having this debate, the reality is it occurs, so what do you do, reject it or accept it and try and do something with it. XHTML simply rejects malformed markup and you get a blank page, HTML tries to make sense of it and render something.<p>&gt;IP stacks do not accept randomly misformatted IP packets. The result is obviously not that you constantly encounter internet services that you can not access because your IP stack is picky about broken IP packets, the result is that noone ever sends you broken IP packets.<p>So you never heard of ECN? The ECN bits being set where technically incorrect depending on how pedantic you where in the interpretation and some stacks rejected packets if the bits weren&#x27;t set to zero. Due to he robustness principle most stacks ignored these bits allowing others to use them for ECN, allowing a graceful update to the spec. The stacks that took your stance however and rejected where simply roadblocks in the adoption.<p>&gt;No, it just isn&#x27;t. You are just looking at a very small part of the consequences of this implementation strategy that indeed happens to be positive, but completely ignoring the big picture of all the externalities and other indirect damage that result from it.<p>I&#x27;m not ignoring anything, I am just pointing out reality, the real world is messy and the stacks that try to keep working under messy conditions seem to be prevailing. Its not pretty and I don&#x27;t deny the issues that arise, but here we are communicating on the largest most successful computer network ever built using a protocol and a markup language built with Postels law in mind.<p>&gt;Erm ... no? The reason why XHTML was abandoned was because people are incompetent at writing software, and there existed an alternative that allowed them to keep their idiotic practices, including all the vulnerabilities and interoperability problems that result from those, so that&#x27;s what people did.<p>I think most who know the history there would disagree with this opinion [1], it was obvious to me at the time why XHTML would fail even though I thought it a cleaner solution, I realized thats what was holding it back. It was much better to see your page come up with maybe a weird rendering artifact than just have the browser render nothing and throw an error if some small part was malformed.<p>&gt;How does that follow?

Since that time, it has been entirely possible (from a technical standpoint) for any properly equipped lab to perform tests.<p>By properly equipped, I mean BSL-2 with a real-time RT-PCR machine - this in not at all an uncommon setup. Other types of PCR machines would require making appropriate modifications to the protocol, but any lab that already does such work will posses the required expertise (seriously, this stuff is _trivial_ by academic standards).<p>Entirely separate from technical ability to perform an assay is legal status with regard to testing human samples for diagnostic purposes. To that end, the FDA failed to approve any vendor-specific test kits in a timely manner.

I just spent a week in Japan, a country at high risk for COVID-19. I wore a mask and essentially tried to stay away from most touristy places (not my first time there), but trains and stations are still packed with people, so there&#x27;s really not much you can do.</i><p><i>On arriving back to America (3 days ago), I developed a 102F fever, coughing, and aches. I went to a local hospital in Brooklyn&#x27;s ER. I informed them of my travel, they provided me a mask, and redirected me to a private room and followed infection protocols (full face covers, gloves, aprons, etc.). I had a chest x-ray and testing for flu&#x2F;cold&#x2F;pneumonia&#x2F;and about 25 other viruses. They all came back negative.</i><p><i>At this point, the hospital called the CDC requesting permission to perform the COVID-19 testing. The CDC denied the request on the ground that I did not have the most life-threatening symptoms: chest pain and shortness of breath. According to everything I read it&#x27;s very likely not to have these symptoms if you&#x27;re in your 30&#x27;s and relatively healthy.</i><p><i>And... that was that. They discharged me, said I don&#x27;t have Corona virus, since they didn&#x27;t test me for it, and said I can ride the subway, return to work, do whatever I want.</i><p><i>Of course my doctor disagreed. She said I should treat myself as if I am infected. My partner is currently staying in a nearby hotel since we live in a studio apartment. I&#x27;ve performed a self-quarantine for 14 days. Fortunately I can work from home and my partner can deliver me groceries if I run out.</i><p><i>But I don&#x27;t think that many people are aware of the fact that they&#x27;re actively not testing people for COVID-19, even people who have travel history to high-risk places.</i><p><i>Do I still have symptoms? Yes, Fever is current 101.6 (as of a couple hours ago), aches, and a cough that is persistent. I&#x27;m taking Tylenol and drinking a lot of water.</i><p><i>Do I just have the flu? Well, not according to my screens I don&#x27;t.</i><p><i>Is this real? It&#x27;s as real as I said it is. I returned from Japan. I&#x27;m sick. The symptoms are similar to COVID19 and I was refused testing.</i><p><i>You can believe whatever you want, I don&#x27;t care.</i><p>A channel NY1 reporter reached out to connect with the individual, so perhaps if validated, it won’t “stay hidden very long”.

The advantage of simulation is its flexibility: the designer can inspect (or even change) the contents of every component, and they can run the clock forwards or backwards until they pinpoint the problem in their design. But the disadvantage of simulation is its slowness: simulating a design can take about 100000 times longer than executing it properly. Sameh’s work describes a way to move the entire state of a design back and forth between an FPGA and a software simulator. His proposal is that a design starts running on an FPGA, then at some predetermined trigger point, the clock is stopped and the current state of the FPGA is copied over to the simulator. The designer can then investigate what is going on at this point, and maybe step the clock forwards or backwards a bit, and then they can copy the new state back to the FPGA and carry on running it. The best of both worlds is thus achieved: the fiddly parts of the design can be run in the simulator, and the long, uninteresting parts can be left to the hardware. Myself, I wondered whether this system could form the basis of an exhaustive hardware simulator: one that runs a design in hardware until comes to some sort of ‘branch’ or ‘decision point’, at which point it saves its current state, and executes one of the paths. Later it restores this saved state and executes the other path. Thus, it might be feasible to explore all the possible behaviours of a system.&quot;",,

22449340,kick,1582959187,22448054,"Spent a good while thinking on your question:<p>The best stuff was all proprietary for decades. Even now, we only got Miranda&#x27;s source code weeks ago. Miranda was written in the 1980s! It&#x27;s the same for a lot of languages. Nial&#x27;s the example I usually bring up for one that was freed far too late. People with the domain knowledge that would have helped deal with the complexity of modern systems are all either retired, have ditched PL-design, or have died.<p>Turbo Pascal, too, although that one&#x27;s kind of strange because the author of it later went on to do a complete 180° turn while still working in PL design and implementation (plus it was never freed).<p>Ken Thompson&#x27;s cc suite for Plan 9 was behind a million-dollar license fee until a decade ago, and it wasn&#x27;t even for any modern CPUs. He once quit the industry to become a flight instructor; he&#x27;s at Google, but he&#x27;s retired now.<p>The best advice is &quot;Stay small!&quot; which most Free Software compilers seem to be violently against. It&#x27;s not their fault, though: it&#x27;s hard not to take new code when it&#x27;s offered to you!<p>We&#x27;ll probably never see the source code behind any version of the k interpreter by Arthur Whitney, and trying to get an interview with him is like going on a snipe hunt, so good luck figuring out anything about his approach besides &quot;Small!&quot; It doesn&#x27;t help that Kx sues the hell out of anyone who&#x27;s actually seen the k source and tries implementing anything remotely like it that&#x27;s not a toy.<p>Every modern compiler is for multiple architectures in convoluted ways. This is generally a terrible idea, especially with how divergent they&#x27;re getting in the times we&#x27;re in, even between chips that have the same instruction set.<p>Intel x86_64 processors aggressively speculate almost as intensely as Transmeta did back in the day, but we&#x27;re still treating them and AMD chips more or less the same, and we&#x27;re using the same compilers that we&#x27;re using on that instruction set for RISC-V and for ARM and for Itanium and for obscure 16-bit CPUs and so on.<p>Portable compilers aren&#x27;t bad in principle, but when you look at pcc compared to GCC you&#x27;ll see exactly where we went wrong: pcc wasn&#x27;t very optimized, it was simple, and it was understandable. Great for bootstrapping. Not great for getting the most out of your CPU. Having portable compilers that try to heavily optimize is a mistake.<p>No one seems to know what a CPU cache is!<p>And how many compilers do you know that compile to C, or to LLVM bytecode or similar? It&#x27;s insane: nobody should be doing that! That approach doesn&#x27;t make much sense!<p>And the only argument any of these people can make is &quot;But our language is too big for it to be practical to write something unique for each architecture! Piggybacking makes it way quicker!&quot;<p>No one seems to realize that their languages are getting <i>too large.</i> They aren&#x27;t even getting too large in a graceful way: Common Lisp is probably the biggest language there is, but it&#x27;s extremely portable, and is easy to write an interpreter for.<p>Things got complicated really fast, and domain knowledge was sort of lost in the waves of proprietary compilers as they were destroyed by GCC. I appreciate that free software &quot;won&quot; to some extent, but if it hadn&#x27;t have won as fast, we might have had some knowledge transfer happen that was actually useful.<p>Walter Bright isn&#x27;t doing magic, but he and the people he work with seem to be some of the only people in Free Software who are making a compiler that&#x27;s fast and good in the x86_64 world.","[22450207, 22449385, 22455606, 22449910, 22453458]",

I looked at a month&#x27;s worth of download logs, and estimated that 1 bit per GB per year flipped on hard disk data for our customers (we had already implemented re-reads before this point, because we had the hashes in place before we did streaming download, and so were pretty sure it was bad data on disk).

22449486,malisper,1582961921,22444453,"Fun fact - a lot of this is kind of stuff is used in SQL databases! Before you finish a transaction (i.e. a sequence of commands), you can rollback the transaction. This will undo the effects of every command ran as part of the transaction. It&#x27;s interesting to take a look at how different production databases implement undo:<p>MySQL and Oracle use the &quot;reconstructing previous states from the current state&quot; strategy. As commands are ran, they keep track of how to undo those commands in the &quot;undo log&quot;. If you rollback a transaction, all they do is run the commands in the undo log.<p>Postgres uses a different strategy. When Postgres modifies a row, it marks the old row as deleted and inserts a new row. Furthermore these changes are associated with the current transaction and considered to be pending until the current transaction completes. If the current transaction fails, Postgres will use the original version of the row because the transaction that modified it never actually completed.<p>SQL databases have a completely separate form of undo used for point in time backups. This is the ability to restore a copy of your database from any point in time in the past. As far as I know, use a combination of the &quot;recording each state&quot; and &quot;reconstructing previous state from initial state&quot;. There&#x27;s two parts to your typical database backup. There&#x27;s the base backup which captures the state of your DB at a specific point in time. Separately there&#x27;s a redo log that captures every change made to the data after the base backup was created. By replaying the changes made before a certain time, you can restore the DB to any state after the base backup was created.",,

The volume of contaminated oily sludge’s and soil, which needs to be treated in Kuwait, is estimated to be more than 20 million m3 ...

The movement of armies and their vehicles  during  the  first  Gulf  War  in  1991  and  the  Iraq  war  in  2003–2005  has caused the fragile desert pavements laid down over thousands of  years to be broken and  destroyed  over  large  areas  of  north-eastern  Saudi  Arabia,  Kuwait  and  many areas of  Iraq. This caused a dramatic increase in the number of  violent sandstorms and dust storms, new dunes blocked roads in northern Kuwait (El-Baz, 1992), and pilots reported a doubling of  dust storms following the Iraq–Iran war in the 1980s.&quot;<p>so I also would like to know how well benefits like the desert bloom  balances the many better-known negative effects.",[22449526],

You simply ignore the second roll if it was a straight test, take worse or better out of the 2 rolls if player had disadvantage&#x2F;advantage<p>- install free chrome extension &quot;vtt enhancement suite&quot; - it allows for executing macros on all selected tokens at once - especially useful for starting combat with lots of enemies - you select for example 10 tokens and click on a macro that rolls initiative for each of them and adds them to the initiative tracker, you ask players to select their tokens and click the same macro - 5 seconds and combat with 16 participants is ready to go - normally I would have to roll physically 10 times, ask players and sort it manually and it would take a minute or 2<p>- use DM layer for hidden enemies&#x2F;traps&#x2F;secret doors&#x2F;notes&#x2F;etc - you can then easily move them to map&#x2F;token layer when players roll perception<p>- reinforcements in a combat are easy when you put some tokens in DM layer - you can add them all to the combat tracker and the tokens on DM layer will be hidden from the players until you move them to token layer<p>- make players drag and drop their most used spells and items to a quick-use bar on the bottom left of the screen - it&#x27;s 15 minutes to set this up on the session 0, but later it eliminates the problem &quot;I closed my character sheet, wait 20 seconds for me to find the button to roll the attack&quot;<p>- set up tokens to have hitpoints and AC bars on them (keep them hidden from players)
 - when you click on hitpoints bar on a token and write &quot;-17&quot; it will automatically decrease the hitpoints by 17 points, don&#x27;t need to substract in your head every time<p>All of this allows me to run combat several times faster than I could possibly do physically, it adds up quickly.",,

We thoroughly looked at a bunch of others and chose UC for its functionality, price, and simplicity (every conference gets a simple phone number, no stupid 9-digit code plus pin plus participant id). Six months after signing a 3-year agreement (my bad. rookie mistake) I had to resist my CEO’s insistence that we switch to a different provider when we were courting them as a client. A few month later, sales went out and bought 10 mf’ing Zoom licenses without consulting anyone because some client hadn’t heard of UC and asked if it was the budget solution.<p>Thank god our new CFO confiscated all the corporate credit cards and moved us to reimbursement with Concur. Of course, he later unilaterally selected NetSuite (for something like $40k a year!)  and insisted on coordinating the roll out himself. It has been a months long dumpster fire, but he still won’t give my team admin privileges lest we try to see other’s salaries.<p>We use a lot of AWS.

It&#x27;s false—instruction cache behavior doesn&#x27;t contribute significantly to k&#x27;s advantage over other languages—for a few reasons: inner loops in array languages are 3–5 orders of magnitude smaller than the CPU cache, the loops that compiled languages produce <i>also</i> fit in cache, and instruction caching doesn&#x27;t matter all that much for performance anyway. Despite spending plenty of time looking for it, I&#x27;ve never been able to measure an impact of code size on performance. Even data caching doesn&#x27;t have that much of an effect: current versions of Dyalog APL almost always allocate new arrays from uncached memory (this is mostly fixed in the next version), and it&#x27;s still one of the fastest array languages around. Unless you&#x27;re using SIMD, code with linear access patterns can&#x27;t even keep up with main memory, and the cache has no effect.<p>Why is using SIMD cheating? SIMD loops are the only way to get the full performance out of a CPU, and fast compilers do try to produce them. If it turns out that array-based interpreters are a better way to convert programmer intentions to SIMD loops than scalar compilers (and it certainly seems that way) then the array languages are legitimately faster. I suppose SIMD is considered &quot;non-portable&quot; because you can&#x27;t use it from C, but that&#x27;s an artificial restriction coming from historical programming language design decisions. The most important vector instructions are the same in any modern vector ISA. How is using standard CPU features cheating?

    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers()
    a = subparsers.add_parser(&#x27;a&#x27;)
    a.add_argument(&#x27;bar&#x27;)

If it would cost more money to stop someone dying or going blind or suffering other major health problems than the typical worker is worth, the NHS just doesn&#x27;t provide that treatment. There are plenty of other workers whose health care needs are much cheaper. Likewise, people wait months for the treatment of conditions that stop them going back to work, and that&#x27;s fine - there are other workers. Highly-paid industries like IT which can&#x27;t treat their employees like replacable cogs often offer private health insurance with lower waiting times as a perk that just happens to benefit them too.<p>This is across the board. On the one end of the spectrum, the NHS only rolled out flu vaccination for infants this flu season and vaccinates a lot less aggressively than the US in general - if you have to vaccinate a large number of people to prevent a few serious illnesses that doesn&#x27;t work out cost-wise. On the other, a lot of the expensive cancer treatments, as well as cutting-edge treatmeents for chronic conditions like cystic fibrosis, aren&#x27;t available either.

I think they ended up making a deal with the drug companies very similar to the one a number of US states did, where they got reduced per-treatment costs as part of a program to aggressive find and treat everyone including homeless people and others who don&#x27;t have access to healthcare.

Unfortunately, most people learn that we have free markets in America. What we really have is nothing like a free market. It&#x27;s some strange mixture of chrony capitalism, elitism, and government regulation. I know this isn&#x27;t a healthcare post, but it&#x27;s a perfect example of a misaligned system that sometimes tries to use the word &quot;free market.&quot; If the market were actually free, the government wouldn&#x27;t pick winners that abandon a motive based on patient and public health outcomes in favor of profit.

Instead of providing to your body the &quot;Wanted&quot; poster with a picture of the virus, it sends the PDF to the cell which then prints its own &quot;Wanted&quot; poster. This makes the response much more predictable, controllable, and robust--your body believes your own cells more than foreign shit from the outside. Since 2015, Moderna has already tested this idea in humans and shown it to be safe with 6 other viral targets (H7 and H10 Flu, Zika, CMV, hMPV&#x2F;PIV, and Chikungunya). In all of these human studies, it has detected antibodies at protective levels against the target virus. So in terms of safety, we are likely already there. This is why Tony Fauci is willing to accelerate so fast. Thinking forward, maybe the US govt will fund manufacturing at risk. Just start making it at scale, right now.

That I am obviously not saying that noone would ever have typed broken HTML into a file if browsers had rejected broken HTML from the start?<p>I mean, it&#x27;s even the norm for implementations of other computer languages to be rather strict about syntax, and it doesn&#x27;t hinder their popularity with the same audience. The exact same people who produce garbage HTML do so using Perl or PHP or Ruby or ... whatever. And whatever you otherwise think about those languages, none of them will just make shit up when there is a syntax error in your program, they will simply reject it. And no, that does not mean that I am claiming that noone has ever made a syntactical mistake when writing code in those languages. But, you know, people are actually capable of fixing those mistakes when they are pointed out to them.<p>&gt; So you never heard of ECN? The ECN bits being set where technically incorrect depending on how pedantic you where in the interpretation and some stacks rejected packets if the bits weren&#x27;t set to zero. Due to he robustness principle most stacks ignored these bits allowing others to use them for ECN, allowing a graceful update to the spec. The stacks that took your stance however and rejected where simply roadblocks in the adoption.<p>Erm ... what? That&#x27;s almost fractally wrong!?<p>None of the ECN problem was one of pedantry, it was simply one of a broken specification, namely the TCP specification. &quot;Reserved for future use.  Must be zero.&quot; is simply a bad specification. If you specify an extension mechanism, you have to always specify how the extension mechanism is supposed to work. What you call the pedantic interpretation is a perfectly valid interpretation of what the text says. You are just looking at it in hindsight, with the idea that it&#x27;s supposed to support the operation of ECN, and then it&#x27;s obviously a problem--but people who implemented TCP stuff before there was ECN could not possibly know that that is how people would expect to use this <i>if the TCP specification doesn&#x27;t specify that</i>. There is nothing wrong with extension mechanisms that work by having the recipient discard messages with flags it doesn&#x27;t know. That&#x27;s just not what ECN chose to do, but that is kinda ECN&#x27;s fault. You might just as well have ended up with a situation where someone would have tried to build an extension that assumes that recipients discard segments with unknown flags, and everyone would have been pointing fingers at those who chose to ignore the flags instead, and how they were pedantic to ignore the flags just because the specification does not explicitly say that such segments are invalid. It&#x27;s just an accident of history that most implementations chose to ignore unknown flags, and therefore people now point to the exception, without any basis other than them being the majority.<p>Also, obviously, the &quot;robustness principle&quot; did not allow for a graceful update to the spec. The fact that a graceful update was not possible is the whole reason why you mentioned ECN at all. And that is not necessarily a result of failing to follow the robustness principle, as the robustness principle really doesn&#x27;t tell you anything useful. All you can do with it is to point at things in hindsight and say &quot;if everyone had built this the same way, then things would be compatible now!&quot; But the robustness principle is useless for actually achieving that. For any format specification, there is an almost infinite number of ways you can deviate from the specification where humans could look at any individual one of those deviations and come to an agreement as to how that deviating message could reasonably be interpreted. And any one of those deviations could in principle be implemented as part of the corresponding parser. But implementing a parser that &quot;correctly&quot; interprets <i>all</i> of those possible deviations is at the very least a major undertaking, and usually even impossible due to contradictions between various deviations when they appear in combination.<p>And that is why hindsight is misleading: In hindsight, you only see one particular (small set of) deviation(s) causing interoperability problems, and it would almost always have been possible to make every parser coherently interpret those deviations just fine, and if everyone had done that, then you would not have any interoperability problems. But that isn&#x27;t the perspective of someone who initially builds the implementation. They can only either strictly follow the spec (which works perfectly if everyone does so and the spec isn&#x27;t broken) or they can increase complexity of and effort required for their implementation an order of magnitude or more to accept close to anything that could happen (which noone does for obvious reasons) or they can implement a random selection of deviations they like (which then leads to interoperability problems and the view in hindsight that everyone else could easily have done the same, which, of course, they couldn&#x27;t, because they couldn&#x27;t know what others were doing). Of course, there is a simple solution to that last approach: If you want to implement deviations from the agreed-upon spec but you don&#x27;t want to run the risk of creating interoperability problems, you could get together with all the other implementers and talk about which deviations everyone is going to implement. But obviously, that&#x27;s just the first approach in disguise: After you have agreed on the deviations, they aren&#x27;t deviations anymore, you have simply created a new spec, and everyone then strictly follows that new spec.<p>Essentially, what is happening here is that you see one interpretation of something that the spec doesn&#x27;t actually specify as obvious. And then you claim that the solution to interoperability problems is that everyone does the obvious thing. But you fail to recognize that the whole problem we are trying to solve with specifications in the first place is that <i>what seems obvious is different for different people</i>. Which is why this (a) can not work and (b) obviously in practice does not work. You can not solve the problem of people having different approaches to problems by simply saying &quot;they should just all have the same approach&quot; while at the same time saying that methods to create agreement (i.e., specifications) should not be taken too seriously.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not ignoring anything, I am just pointing out reality, the real world is messy and the stacks that try to keep working under messy conditions seem to be prevailing. Its not pretty and I don&#x27;t deny the issues that arise, but here we are communicating on the largest most successful computer network ever built using a protocol and a markup language built with Postels law in mind.<p>Then your points are just irrelevant? I never said that broken systems can not be successful, did I? Yes, there clearly are evolutionary advantages to externalizing costs, and taking risks can pay off. But there are also other parties who have to pay those externalized costs, and taking risks can also end in a catastrophe. Externalizing costs is still an asshole move (and is generally frowned upon by society when people understand that that is what is happening) and whether the risks taken by the web, for example, have actually paid off is far from obvious.<p>Also, possibly all of this was built with Postel&#x27;s law in mind. But what I would be interested in is whether that was to our benefit. Just because something was a factor in creating a certain overall positive situation does not mean that therefore that factor made that situation better than if it hadn&#x27;t been there. In particular, evolutionary success does not mean that a different approach would not have produced a better result.<p>&gt; I think most who know the history there would disagree with this opinion [1], it was obvious to me at the time why XHTML would fail even though I thought it a cleaner solution, I realized thats what was holding it back. It was much better to see your page come up with maybe a weird rendering artifact than just have the browser render nothing and throw an error if some small part was malformed.<p>How does that contradict what I said? Yes, it was obvious that XHTML would fail due to the massive incompetence of developers ... your point being?!<p>&gt; Uh gee I don&#x27;t know maybe Postel&#x27;s law is kinda relevant when discussing TCP because Postel wrote the spec you know like what you asked in the post before? What kind of game are you playing here?<p>I am not sure what kind of game you are playing, but I had the impression like you were trying to make a point and not just state the historical fact that that&#x27;s where Postel formulated the &quot;robustness principle&quot;.

The light is universal transmitter &amp; transformer. The light is concentrated knowledge that is transmitted from the sun to every particle of the planet and peoples, and thanks to the light, matter and a variety of life forms are created, which creates a variety of forms of matter.
The idea of Christianity about the resurrection of people is magnificent, then such great people as Dyson could be resurrected, why not? But technologies are needed in new physics and medicine, which would gain access to reality at the nanoparticle level. A 3D printer that prints the light and lays knowledge into the light to recreate a person. There is a pattern that the more we get access at the micro level, the more powerful chips we can build, and more powerful chips can calculate more hashes and allow us to bring in new gigantic machines, like telescopes and spaceships, which will give access to new macro-knowledge such as dark matter and black holes of matter-time consensus, which will allow us to create new petabyte flash drives based on light, and new the light based computers will be able to burn information directly to the points of space, and what it means to materialize any object, which will provide access to new knowledge and made new grand chips &amp; telescopes.  We already partially use the light in our rooms, networks and cameras and monitors to exchange information. New theories and machines based on the light will allow creating new machines for controlling the space-time continent and copying knowledge from any space-time, and then the task of resurrecting people becomes feasible and we can transfer the consciousness of this particular person from the past without distortion. If this happens in the next 5,000 years, then Dyson saw it right. To create such machines, we need new geniuses with Dyson&#x27;s light.

The other core issue that lead to the creation of Haskell was Miranda&#x27;s license that essentially prohibited using it as a tool for programming language research. For good reason, Turner (Miranda&#x27;s creator) wanted to avoid the fragmentation of Miranda into different dialects. From [1]:<p>&gt; <i>[T]he easiest way to move forward was to begin with an existing language, and evolve it in whatever direction suited us. Of all the lazy languages under development, David Turner’s Miranda was by far the most mature. It was pure, well designed, fulfilled many of our goals, had a robust implementation as a product of Turner’s company, Research Software Ltd, and was running at 120 sites. Turner was not present at the meeting, so we concluded that the first action item of the committee would be to ask Turner if he would allow us to adopt Miranda as the starting point for our new language. After a brief and cordial interchange, Turner declined. His goals were different from ours. We wanted a language that could be used, among other purposes, for research into language features; in particular, we sought the freedom for anyone to extend or modify the language, and to build and distribute an implementation. Turner, by contrast, was strongly committed to maintaining a single language standard, with complete portability of programs within the Miranda community. He did not want there to be multiple dialects of Miranda in circulation and asked that we make our new language sufficiently distinct from Miranda that the two would not be confused. Turner also declined an invitation to join the new design committee [...] Haskell owes a considerable debt to Miranda, both for general inspiration and specific language elements that we freely adopted where they fitted into our emerging design.</i><p>[1] P.

I believe that after is generally superior, especially when the type is optional.<p>But there’s a very practical reason for requiring the `let` token: it makes parsing <i>very</i> much easier. With `let`, you can keep a LL(1) grammar, because seeing `let` tells you to next parse a pattern, then if there’s a colon a type after that. But if you don’t put <i>something</i> in there, you get a genuinely intractable problem once type grammar is not trivial: sure, `int foo;` is simple and obvious, but what about `A&lt;B, C&gt; d;`? should that be parsed as an expression (respaced, `A &lt; B, C &gt; d;`). Some languages have not resolved this style of parsing ambiguity at all, and figure it out at runtime, based on what else they find (Perl is infamous for this). I <i>think</i> others only kind-of resolve it, by looking at what symbols are present at compile time, to decide what was meant. Others just declare that such ambiguities are parsed one way, and you can rewrite your code (e.g. add parentheses) if you want to mean the other. Still others have resolved it otherwise, by other more subtle syntactic means, so that even if you need arbitrary look-ahead while parsing, there’s not <i>quite</i> any overlap between the two syntaxes (e.g. don’t support commas in this way as a kind of alternative to semicolon within expressions; or use proper matched delimiters like [] or () for generics).<p>Rust chooses to make parsing simple, which benefits humans as well as machines, reducing cognitive requirements in reading code.<p>Furthermore, in Rust what follows `let` is <i>not an identifier or identifier list</i>, but rather a <i>pattern</i>. Imagine the following contrived example:<p><pre><code>  let x = [[0]];
  type x = [u32; 1];
  let a = 0;
  let [a]: x = [1];
</code></pre>
That falls over <i>completely</i> if you put the type first: `x [a] = [1];`—does that define a new binding <i>a</i> with value 1, or does it set x[0] to [1]?<p>And finally, as I mentioned, the type is optional, and not commonly required, so you end up with something like C++’s `auto` keyword, which is basically `let` but spelled worse (and with worse semantics).<p>The end result is that <i>for Rust specifically</i>, what you desire is quite unsuitable, and what it has works very well—and that its reasons for doing things that way are well worth while considering.",,

22450529,masklinn,1582984406,22446180,"Basically, exceptions have a &quot;happy path&quot; which is very simple but deviating from that path is often quite inconvenient and painful. A well-built result type makes it easy to opt into the happy path of exceptions, and also quite easy to use different schemes and deviate from that path, all the while being much safer than exceptions because you&#x27;re not relying on runtime type informations and assumptions.<p>Furthermore, results make it much less likely to &quot;overscope&quot; error handlers (there a try block catches unrelated exceptions from 3 different calls) as the overhead is relatively low and there&#x27;s necessarily a 1:1 correspondance between calls and results; and it&#x27;s also less likely to &quot;miscatch&quot; exceptions (e.g. have too broad or too narrow catch clauses) because you should know exactly what the call can fail with at runtime. It&#x27;s still possible to make mistakes, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but I think it&#x27;s easier to get things right.<p>&quot;Path unification&quot; is a big one in my experience: by design exceptions completely split the path of &quot;success&quot; and &quot;failure&quot; (the biggest split being when you do nothing at all where they immediately return from the enclosing function).<p>This is by far the most common thing you want so in a way it makes sense as a default, but it&#x27;s problematic when you <i>don&#x27;t</i> want the default because then things get way worse e.g. if you have two functions which return a value and can fail and you <i>need</i> to call them both, now you need some sort of sentinel garbage for the result you don&#x27;t get, and you need a bunch of shenanigans to get all the crap you need out<p><pre><code>    int a;
    SomeException e_a = null;
    try {
        a = something();
    } except (SomeException e) {
        a = -1;
        e_a = e;
    }
    int b;
    SomeException e_b = null;
    try {
        b = something();
    } except (SomeException e) {
        b = -1;
        e_b = e;
    }
    if (e_a != null or e_b != null) { &#x2F;&#x2F; don&#x27;t mess that up because both a and b are &quot;valid&quot; here
        …
    }
</code></pre>
or you duplicate the path in both the rest of the body and the except clause (possibly creating a function to hold that), etc…<p>By comparison, results are a reification so splitting the path is an explicit operation, but at the same time they still don&#x27;t allow accessing the success in case of failure, or the failure in case of success.<p><pre><code>    let result_a = something();
    let result_b = something();
    if let Err(_) = result_a.and(result_b) { &#x2F;&#x2F; or pattern matching or something else
        …
    }
</code></pre>
Having a reified object also allows building abstractions on top of it much more easily e.g. if you call a library and you want to convert its exceptions into yours you need to remember to<p><pre><code>    try {
        externalCall()
    } except (LibraryException e} {
        throw MyException.from(e); &#x2F;&#x2F; because that might want to dispatch between various sub-types
    }
</code></pre>
and if you don&#x27;t remember to put this everywhere the inner exception will leak out (that&#x27;s assuming you don&#x27;t have checked exceptions because Java&#x27;s are terrible and nobody else has them).<p>Meanwhile with results the Result from `externalCall` is not compatible with yours so this:<p><pre><code>    return externalCall();
</code></pre>
will fail to compile with a type mismatch, and then you can add convenience utilities to make it easy to convert between the errors of the external library and your own, and further make it easy to opt into an exception-style pattern. e.g. Rust&#x27;s `?`<p><pre><code>    externalCall()?
</code></pre>
is roughly:<p><pre><code>    match externalCall() {
        Ok(value) =&gt; value,
        Err(error) =&gt; { return Err(From::from(error))); }
    }

This effectively means you can only have one Python thread per processor running at a time, which is frustrating because that kinda defeats the point of threading. However, most python programs aren&#x27;t CPU bound, but I&#x2F;O bound. For those programs, using the python multithreading abstraction is fine; CPUs are fast enough to do context switches while one thread waits for data, etc. For CPU bound tasks, the solution is to write using the multiprocess module; each process spun up has its own interpreter and its own GIL. Things have changed somewhat with Python 3, where there are some more robust internal scheduling tools inside the multithreading module, but the rule of thumb still stays the same.",,

This effectively onboarded all 3 of them.

For example,<p>let x: i32 = 42;
let y: fn(i32) = foo;
let z: <i>\const [i32] = bar;<p>but also:<p>struct Entity { id: i32, vel: (f32, f32) }<p>let e: Entity; &#x2F;&#x2F; given<p>let Entity { vel .. } = e; &#x2F;&#x2F; vel points to e.vel<p>let Entity { vel: (v_x, ..), .. } = e; &#x2F;&#x2F; v_x points to e.vel.x;<p>&#x2F;&#x2F; Works in function arguments:<p>fn foo(Entitiy { vel, .. }: Entity) -&gt; (f32, f32) { vel }<p>&#x2F;&#x2F; Works in for loops:<p>for Entitiy { id, .. } in entities() {<p><pre><code>   &#x2F;&#x2F; use the id of the entity

But, you know, people are actually capable of fixing those mistakes when they are pointed out to them.<p>Except its pretty common now for programming languages add quality of life changes that loosen some of the strict parsing rules, such as trailing commas or optional semi colons. Same with whitespace, many languages don&#x27;t pay much attention to it then you have a formatter that is strict about it (gofmt). This is Postels law in action, liberal acceptance strict output. The alternative is strict adherence to whitespace then no need for a formatter, just have the compiler reject it and put the burden on the programmer.<p>&gt;Also, obviously, the &quot;robustness principle&quot; did not allow for a graceful update to the spec.<p>Again your opinion is not shared historically, ECN is held up as an example of the robustness principle having been followed in most stacks, with some problem ones that did not causing some issues [1].<p>&gt;Then your points are just irrelevant?<p>Then your points are just irrelevant?

Yeah, I agree, that&#x27;s what he did. And it was a bad idea.<p>&gt;As for TCP ... how is it relevant that Postel wrote the spec? Does that mean that the vulnerabilities in TCP never happened? Or are you saying that modern TCP implementations try to accept any crap whatsoever? (No, they don&#x27;t, of course they don&#x27;t, people have actually learned that that&#x27;s a bad idea.)<p>Going back to you original question since your having hard time connecting the dots, Postel wrote the spec for TCP and put his law in the spec as guidance. ECN was developed taking advantage of that principle and most stacks accepted the malformed packets because of it. There are other examples of this [2], TCP is complicated if stacks didn&#x27;t follow Postels law they would never get anything done on the internet.<p>1. <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;draft-ietf-tcpm-generalized-ecn-05#section-4.2.2.2"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;draft-ietf-tcpm-generalized-ecn-...</a>

Vast money was also spent on the equipment required to provide the care, and the drugs. This was all provided by the NHS, and is provided routinely. So - your statement is flatly untrue.<p>On the other hand I have received very little treatment on the NHS; I have required medical interventions but only after I was rich enough to get insurance. This is the key to the economics. Some people require heroic intervention to survive, most people (until they are in their old age) require very little (especially if engaged in preventative health improvement) - this is what makes it sustainable, not parsimony with the treatment.<p>&gt;This is across the board. On the one end of the spectrum, the NHS only rolled out flu vaccination for infants this flu season and vaccinates a lot less aggressively than the US in general - if you have to vaccinate a large number of people to prevent a few serious illnesses that doesn&#x27;t work out cost-wise.<p>The UK and NHS have strong policies and incentive structures to drive vaccination, precisely because without it a large number of people suffer illnesses that are very expensive. I don&#x27;t know the numbers but I am pretty sure that 10k vaccinations are cheaper than 2 weeks in hospital for one child with measles. Your reasoning simply makes no economic sense; prevention is clearly better than cure, and cheaper.<p>&gt; some bizarre business where the NHS decided not to offer a cost-effective cure for Hepatitis C to most people with it, even though it&#x27;s a communicable disease with serious long-term health effects and curing them would probably save money in the long run, because the short-term cost was too high.<p>Or you could say &quot;the NHS used its purchasing power to drive a procurement deal which enabled it to launch a program to eliminate Hep-C by 2025, and had to fight in the courts to make it stick&quot; which would be factual.<p>&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how well the NHS would cope with a coronavirus pandemic either. In a good year it barely has enough resources to handle the seasonal flu, and this has been the worst flu season for it in a long time.<p>Well - all health services will be stretched.

Now you pay 10x what you used to for phone service (in the US; elsewhere else it&#x27;s fine) due to oligopolistic pricing, and you have a bunch of dumb &quot;apps&quot; on your phone charging you, 3 different movie services, even your damn radio betrays you. Managing more such things is unpleasant and the whole world is basically a giant ripoff<p>3) Social atomization in the US is at all time high, mostly due to technology<p>4) Search engines, homeless people and Elsevier have destroyed physical libraries, and that&#x27;s a real loss.<p>5) The internet is dumber and more corporate, and opinion makers now think that Usenet arguments on twitter are meaningful and real: something the rest of us got over around 1991<p>6) Cheap LED lights means designers put them everywhere, and you have to work hard to sleep in a dark room<p>7) Movies are shittier; big deal that I can watch a capeshit movie in 4k.

It arises because we perceive things only indirectly, via our mental representations of them. We (our minds) live in an inner, virtual, world. It matches the outer world only partially. The match is limited by matters such as how rational we are, how much we know, how much our culture knows, what our misconceptions and mistakes are, and so on. All very much in line with Karl Popper&#x27;s epistemology.<p>Our mental representations <i>are</i> alive in the sense that they are labile and interconnected in all sorts of ways that make up our worldview. Creative geniuses don&#x27;t consider their tools dispassionately. They literally relate to them, e.g. a certain equation might be like an old friend.<p>The problem for the animists is that just because things (trees, rocks, equations) are connected in our minds does not imply they are connected in the real, external universe. There aren&#x27;t spirits &#x27;out there&#x27;. If there is a spirit, it&#x27;s &#x27;in here&#x27; working behind the scene. It&#x27;s the operation of our own brain. So primitive cultures had a very limited knowledge of how the outer physical world worked outside of necessary activities such as hunting. Scientific knowledge came later.<p>Materialists, on the other hand, i.e. most of us nowadays, assume that they perceive external physical reality directly. They forget they had to spend months just learning to <i>see</i> things when they were babies. (Or that this process was more about sorting out what was what than about building a telescope.) They assume that objects are are unconnected, like atoms in a void. This is of course true on the wider physical level but merely self-fulfilling in the inner world. Thus their mental representations of things (not us) remain relatively dormant. They never hear the &#x27;wind in the willows&#x27; and never realise their full creative power.",,

Perhaps because, given the encapsulation, a punishment coming from your boss&#x27;s boss can never &quot;run downhill&quot; to end up falling on you (though, nor can a reward); instead, each node on the org-chart can only rewrd&#x2F;punish their direct report.

I disagree—it’s ideal that we have a canonical general purpose library and another for high performance cases.<p>Perhaps you would argue that we should have interfaces that allow for a pluggable performant implementation and an easy-to-use general purpose implementation? This is all well and good, but it’s inherently not possible, because the interface is about ease-of-use and the performance is achieved by trading off on friendliness. You might offer Rust as a counterpoint since many of its standard libraries use an interface that is suitable for the general case and the high performance cases; however, this is a lie: these interfaces (and the core language) are manifold harder to use than their Go equivalents. In other words, Rust’s “general purpose” interfaces trade ease of use for the ability to support high performance implementations. This tradeoff isn’t inherently bad, but it is bad to pretend as though it’s <i>inherently good</i> or that there is no tradeoff at all.",,

In contrast, a computer can display anything and rearrange its UI depending on the context. Example: most POS software has a specific way (usually a button) to put an order on hold and be able to start ringing up the next customer&#x27;s items while the existing order is invisible in the background, because on a physical POS there&#x27;s no way to just duplicate the keyboard and screen and become two POSes side by side. On a computer however, the same is trivial by just having 2 tabs, both with the POS UI but containing the different orders. Most people would immediately recognise and understand (because of prior experience with browser tabs) without a need for training",[22453007],

22451535,CaptArmchair,1582995907,22451162,"I interpret it like this: Twitter somehow intended threading as this revolutionary innovation all along...<p>... which couldn&#x27;t be further removed from reality.<p>Going back into the past, Twitter originated as a side-project without a clear goal or business model. Over the past 15 odd years, it has pivoted several times, depending on how the audience interacted with the service, and what were best decisions towards monetization. No more, no less.<p>At one point, Twitter was a micro-blogging platform. It didn&#x27;t even invent micro-blogging. There were many services alike at the time such as identi.ca, FriendFeed, Plurk, Tumblr and so on (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Microblogging"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Microblogging</a>).<p>The main reason why tweets were originally 140 characters long was because they made it relatively easy - for the time - to connect with the service through text messages. Remember: Twitter originated in the era before the iPhone was introduced. They stuck with that limit because that was what set Twitter apart and what made it radically different from other services.<p>Threaded Twitter entirely hinges on the notion of @ mentions. Which wasn&#x27;t originally even a feature of the service. It took until 2008 before they added that @replies and only in late 2009 they became @ mentions as we know them now. <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mention_(blogging)#@_(At_sign)"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mention_(blogging)#@_(At_sign)</a><p>At that point, they didn&#x27;t even have this vision of &quot;threads&quot;. Users simply started to create these &quot;cowpaths&quot; on their own in order to circumvent the 140 character limit by @ mentioning themselves and creating these long reads on the platform.<p>The primary reason why doing that is appealing... is because that&#x27;s where the audience is. Because Twitter happened to funnel massive social networks into a centralized solution which gives individuals the immediacy of communication at zero financial cost.<p>Put differently, if individuals would be able to reach out to a large audience through a decentralized online solution as part of a public commons at zero cost and with the same level of immediacy, there wouldn&#x27;t be much need for a service like Twitter. Whether or not content is threaded isn&#x27;t even relevant. That&#x27;s just the form, and that always follows the function.<p>Twitter doesn&#x27;t represent society at large nor does it represent how humanity at large communicates. It&#x27;s just one of many forms of communication, albeit a very visible one as large amounts of capital have been sunk into this particular private venture.<p>As such, the prerogative of being part of the crowd using a decentralized, open infrastructure is that one is always free to look for new and different ways to connect, communicate and convince that don&#x27;t necessarily have to be subjected to the whims of a single private actor. If threads on Twitter work out for you, even when Twitter designs against them, that&#x27;s fine. If you want to use some other tool, that&#x27;s valid too.<p>Even in the age of social media, there are still people running BBS&#x27;es.",,

Here is a link to an unoffical version of the standard: <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.open-std.org&#x2F;jtc1&#x2F;sc22&#x2F;wg14&#x2F;www&#x2F;docs&#x2F;n1256.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.open-std.org&#x2F;jtc1&#x2F;sc22&#x2F;wg14&#x2F;www&#x2F;docs&#x2F;n1256.pdf</a> . However, this is not the right place to look for if you just want to understand the simple principle behind declarations, because the purity of declaration syntax has been considerably diluted in the last decades. So, only look in the standard if you are in good psychological health, and need to implement a production-grade C compiler. Also, note that grammars are overrated and tend to make things more complex than they really are. They are often too theoretical of a construct to be applicable, and that is certainly true for a language like C.<p>Instead, I recommend you to read the idea from the horse&#x27;s mouth, here is Dennis Ritchie talking about it: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bell-labs.com&#x2F;usr&#x2F;dmr&#x2F;www&#x2F;chist.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bell-labs.com&#x2F;usr&#x2F;dmr&#x2F;www&#x2F;chist.html</a><p>&gt; I don&#x27;t see a &quot;type name followed by an expression and a semicolon&quot;, but rather the grammar &quot;TYPE_NAME NAME = EXPR;&quot;.<p>Let&#x27;s ignore the optional equal sign + initializer expression, and just focus on declarations without initializers. The syntax is (as I said) &quot;TYPE_NAME EXPR;&quot; where EXPR is an expression that makes use of the newly-declared variable.<p>&gt; (e.g. a function pointer won&#x27;t work)<p>Not sure what you mean by &quot;function pointer&quot;, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s not a type name in the way I mean it. Here is how to look at your examples:<p><pre><code>    void (*foo)(int) = expr;
                     ^^^^^^ (optional) initializer
         ^^^^^^^^^^^ expression (originally it was (*foo)(x),
                                 but as I said nowadays there are
                                 type specifiers in the list which
                                 is a little inconsistent.)
    ^^^^ type name 

    int (*foo)[N] = expr;
                  ^^^^^^ (optional) initializer
         ^^^^^^^^ expression
    ^^^ type name
</code></pre>
Basically, the first example says &quot;(* foo)(int) is a void&quot;, so you can conclude that foo is a pointer to a function that takes an int and returns a void.<p>The second example says &quot;(* foo)[N] is an int&quot; so you can conclude that foo is a pointer to an array of N ints.",,

No. Lists and tables (tables are btw GitHub-flavored markdown but not supported by John Gruber&#x27;s original Markdown.PL) aren&#x27;t so much a problem as reference links where you need unbounded lookahead. Eg markdown allows links such as &quot;[a link][linktarget]&quot;, then have a definition for linktarget such as<p><pre><code>    [linktarget]: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blabla.com
      &quot;Link title&quot; 
</code></pre>
anywhere before or after the link use in the document, and requires that the link text &quot;Link title&quot; appears as the value of the title attribute of the anchor tag generated from the link use. That doesn&#x27;t work with SGML short references which are strictly local transformations.<p>However, SGML has the concept of <i>public declaration text</i> to make markdown-to-HTML transformation appear transparently &quot;as if&quot; it were implemented using short references when actually an integrated hardcoded markdown renderer is used. The following DTD captures this concept and tells an SGML parser (that knows about markdown by the given public identifier) to switch on markdown processing:<p><pre><code>    &lt;!DOCTYPE html [
     &lt;!ELEMENT html O O (head,body)&gt;
     &lt;!-- ... --&gt;
     &lt;!ENTITY % md_shortref_maps

     %md_shortref_maps;
    ]&gt;
    ...
</code></pre>
What this does is that it - virtually - pulls in shortref declarations for markdown into a parameter entity (md_shortref_maps), then references&#x2F;expands that parameter entity such that it becomes part of the declaration set text. But an SGML parser is free to interpret declarations denoted by the public identifier as purely symbolic, and treat the parameter entity reference as a signal to switch on markdown processing. So this is kindof cheating, but in a way that is conformant with SGML, and retaining its declarative semantics.<p>&gt; <i>Are you saying that an ordinary SGML parser will produce the expected tree for any valid HTML 5 document as specified in the HTML5 spec [...] using your DTD?</i><p>In [1] (see &quot;TALK&quot; slides), I&#x27;ve reported on results for parsing w3c-tests.org&#x2F;html tests:<p>&gt; <i>sgmlproc [...] restricted to relevant test cases, succeeds in parsing 942 of 966, or 97.31% of the html52lib tests suite</i><p>That has to be put into context, though. The test suite normatively referenced by the W3C spec is based on the older html5lib test suite (Python-based parser) and a moving target (the spec doesn&#x27;t reference a particular commit); frankly, the relation W3C&#x27;s spec has with html5lib tests isn&#x27;t sufficiently clear. There&#x27;s also a (supposedly) more relevant test suite created&#x2F;maintained as part of W3C&#x27;s validator.nu effort (a HTML5 parser written in Java which to my knowledge also doesn&#x27;t align with a particular HTML version, just as WHATWG HTML itself isn&#x27;t versioned), and which might or might not be maintained. Also, the test suite is written in such a way that tests always produce a result (because that&#x27;s what HTML5 does - give a consistent meaning to any bytes that could be sent to a browser) using the procedural spec for HTML parsing given in chapter 8, whereas my DTD is based on the normative grammar rules given in chapter 4 of the spec.

The concept of a meta program that Jonathon Blow talked about on the &quot;On the Metal&quot; podcast is wild.<p>A macro syntax that was both expressive&#x2F;hygienic, but allowed for better integration with tooling (frequently tools have no introspection into expanded macro code, and debugging macros almost always sucks). I&#x27;m not sure how to solve this problem however, but I think procedural macros in Rust are a decent enough start (debugging them sucks right now, but I see no reason why that has to be the case).<p>Along the same lines of the previous paragraphs (programming things around the program itself, like meta programming) is that the build process in most languages sucks, and requires using outside tools in different languages (be it a config file, make script, python&#x2F;shell scripting, etc). I&#x27;d really like it if I could write my entire build process in the language I&#x27;m building, including pre&#x2F;post build steps, specifying a dependency tree, etc.<p>An idea I love to work with is a purely declarative syntax, similar to configuration languages like TOML or JSON. But inside declarations you can write imperative code that synthesizes your declarative code programmatically. Now you can do this in JS today with some discipline, and make it kinda typed in Typescript. But if you have a fairly strict and limited type system and good error messaging&#x2F;debugging workflow it&#x27;s actually a fairly powerful concept. It helps deal with the oscillation in the industry between &quot;configuration is code&quot; and &quot;configuration is actually a bitch to write for complex systems.&quot; You can start with a pure configuration for your system, but then as complexity grows write imperative code that synthesizes the configuration.",[22453339],

If twitter was created as a tool to influence politics, it would drastically changed who signed up for the platform, and it&#x27;s influence and reach. There are plenty of platforms that have tried that route, and not a single one has been successful. Reddit is in a similar position as Twitter on this same issue, and take a look at Voat to see what that looks like. Therefore, Singer seeks to obtain influence he would not have had by co-opting a platform created for other purposes.<p>Second, Twitters political leanings are incidental. Twitter&#x27;s employees are human beings, and when they make a decision, they are biased by their own thoughts and opinions, which happen to generally be on the left. While leftist, this still allows people like Trump and other conservatives to use the platform... and it limits what political actions they can take (they cant get too extreme or their diverse user base may revolt). In other words, this is a passive bias.<p>Whereas Singer (may--we don&#x27;t really know his motives) seek to turn Twitter into a political weapon that he can use to battle liberalism. That&#x27;s an active bias. And depending on how active he wants to get with politics using Twitter, it may destroy the platform.<p>A passive bias is very different than an active bias.

If you memoized it, the memo structure caching the suffixes would become massive and you&#x27;d spend just almost as much time looping the results from it as you would just walking down the tree, so you might as well save yourself the memory and just walk down the tree. Like, the length of the cached answer is more or less the same as the runtime of just doing the recursion, so you&#x27;re not actually saving much of anything by memoization, and you&#x27;re wasting a whole lot of memory.<p>I guess you could instead return some kind of fancy &quot;prefix DAG&quot; containing all possible strings, and that would be faster.

I haven&#x27;t quite thought through what going full-on DP and turning the recursion upside down would do, but I assume it would work just fine.<p>But given that the number of possible solutions is a massive O(2^n) (probably, anyway), that puts a floor on the runtime you can&#x27;t algorithm your way out of.

Economist Nouriel Roubini correctly predicted the 2008 financial crisis. Now, he believes that stock markets will plunge by 30 to 40 percent because of the coronavirus. And that Trump will lose his re-election bid.

Economist Roubini: &quot;The markets are completely delusional.&quot;
Economist Roubini: &quot;The markets are completely delusional.&quot;AP
Nouriel Roubini is one of the most prominent and enigmatic economists in the world. He correctly predicted the bursting of the U.S. housing bubble in addition to the 2008 financial crisis along with the ramifications of austerity measures for debt-laden Greece. Roubini is famous for his daring prognostications and now, he has another one: He believes that coronavirus will lead to a global economic disaster and that U.S. President Donald Trump will not be re-elected as a result.<p>DER SPIEGEL: How severe is the coronavirus outbreak for China and for the global economy?<p>Roubini: This crisis is much more severe for China and the rest of the world than investors have expected for four reasons: First, it is not an epidemic limited to China, but a global pandemic. Second, it is far from being over. This has massive consequences, but politicians don’t realize it.<p>DER SPIEGEL: What do you mean?<p>Roubini: Just look at your continent. Europe is afraid of closing its borders, which is a huge mistake. In 2016, in response to the refugee crisis, Schengen was effectively suspended, but this is even worse. The Italian borders should be closed as soon as possible. The situation is much worse than 1 million refugees coming to Europe.<p>DER SPIEGEL: What are your other two reasons?<p>Roubini: Everyone believes it’s going to be a V-shaped recession, but people don’t know what they are talking about. They prefer to believe in miracles. It’s simple math: If the Chinese economy were to shrink by 2 percent in the first quarter, it would require growth of 8 percent in the final three quarters to reach the 6 percent annual growth rate that everyone had expected before the virus broke out. If growth is only 6 percent from the second quarter onwards, which is a more realistic scenario, we would see the Chinese economy only growing by 2.5 to 4 percent for the entire year. This rate would essentially mean a recession for China and a shock to the world.<p>&quot;The Chinese government will need a scapegoat.&quot;
DER SPIEGEL: And your last point?<p>Roubini: Everyone thinks that policymakers will react swiftly but that’s also wrong. The markets are completely delusional. Look at fiscal policy: You can do fiscal stuff only in some countries like Germany, because others like Italy don’t have any leeway. But even if you do something, the political process requires a great deal of talking and negotiating. It takes six to nine months, which is way too long. The truth is: Europe would have needed fiscal stimulus even without the corona crisis. Italy was already on the verge of a recession, as was Germany. But German politicians aren’t even thinking about stimulus, despite the country being so exposed to China. The political response is a joke - politicians are often behind the curve. This crisis will spill over and result in a disaster.<p>DER SPIEGEL: What role do the central banks have to play?<p>Roubini: The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan are already in negative territory. Of course, they could lower rates on deposits even further to stimulate borrowing but that wouldn’t help the markets for more than a week. This crisis is a supply shock that you can’t fight with monetary or fiscal policy.<p>DER SPIEGEL: What will help?<p>Roubini: The solution needs to be a medical one. Monetary and fiscal measures do not help when you have no food and water safety. If the shock leads to a global recession, then you have a financial crisis, because debt levels have gone up and the U.S. housing market is experiencing a bubble just like in 2007. It hasn’t been a time bomb so far because we have been experiencing growth. That is over now.<p>DER SPIEGEL: Will this crisis change the way the Chinese people think of their government?<p>Roubini: Businesspeople tell me that things in China are much worse than the government is officially reporting. A friend of mine in Shanghai has been locked in his home for weeks now. I don’t expect a revolution, but the government will need a scapegoat.<p>DER SPIEGEL: Such as?<p>Roubini: Already, there were conspiracy theories going around about foreign interference when it comes to swine flu, bird flu and the Hong Kong uprising. I assume that China will start trouble in Taiwan, Hong Kong or even Vietnam. They’ll crack down on protesters in Hong Kong or send fighters over Taiwanese air space to provoke the U.S. military. It would only take one accident in the Strait of Formosa and you would see military action. Not a hot war between China and the U.S., but some form of action. This is what people in the U.S. government like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo or Vice President Mike Pence want. It’s the mentality of many people in D.C.<p>DER SPIEGEL: This crisis is obviously a setback for globalization. Do you think politicians like Trump, who want their companies to abandon production abroad, will benefit?<p>Roubini: He will try to reap benefits from this crisis, that’s for sure. But everything will change when coronavirus reaches the U.S. You can’t build a wall in the sky. Look, I live in New York City and people there are hardly going to restaurants, cinemas or theaters, even though nobody there has been infected by the virus thus far. If it comes, we are totally fucked.<p>&quot;Trump is dead. Quote me on that!&quot;
DER SPIEGEL: A perfect scare-scenario for Trump?<p>Roubini: Not at all. He will lose the election, that’s for sure.<p>DER SPIEGEL: A bold prediction. What makes you so sure?<p>Roubini: Because there is a significant risk of a war between the U.S. and Iran. The U.S. government wants regime change, and they will bomb the hell out of the Iranians. But Iranians are used to suffering, believe me, I am an Iranian Jew, and I know them! And the Iranians also want regime change in the U.S. The tensions will drive up oil prices and lead inevitably to Trumps defeat in the elections.<p>DER SPIEGEL: What makes you so sure?<p>Roubini: This has always the case in history. Ford lost to Carter after the 1973 oil shock, Carter lost to Reagan due to the second oil crisis in 1979, and Bush lost to Clinton after the Kuwait invasion. The Democratic field is poor, but Trump is dead. Quote me on that!<p>DER SPIEGEL: A war against Iran is needed to beat Trump?<p>Roubini: Absolutely, and it’s worth it. Four more years of Trump means economic war!<p>DER SPIEGEL: What should investors do to brace for the impact?<p>Roubini: I expect global equities to tank by 30 to 40 percent this year. My advice is: Put your money into cash and safe government bonds, like German bunds. They have negative rates, but so what? That just means that prices will rise and rise - you can make a lot of money that way. And if I am wrong and equities go up by 10 percent instead, that’s also OK. You have to hedge your money against a crash, that is more important. That’s my motto: &quot;Better safe than sorry!&quot;",,

22452658,davismwfl,1583006350,22450950,"Compensation and equity are not the same, vesting over time is not equal to a raise (or &quot;effectively a raise&quot;).  Compensation is what you were paid and what you were taxed on (typically) during the year.  Equity is never compensation until&#x2F;unless the company&#x27;s shares are marketable, then it can count as compensation (kind of a general statement, there are nuances of course).  I like to explain compensation this way, if you can deposit what the company gave you into a traditional bank then it is compensation, everything else is either a future promise or a potential liability.<p>I could write a ton on this, but let me say this.  A company that delays their A is either knocking it out of the park so they don&#x27;t need to take the dilution and see a path possibly of not raising an A, OR they have issues and are trying to figure it out.  If they are doing so well, the company may delay their Series A but good founders will recognize they cannot delay taking care of employees just because they delayed the Series A.  They may limit the number of increases and make them smaller than they originally planned, but they will take care of the employees that are making them successful, because if you lose those employees you lose momentum and possible the business if it is still only a few people.<p>Your founder is either just inexperienced and talking out his&#x2F;her ass trying to justify their position or they are being deceitful for a reason.  I&#x27;d always err on the side of a young founder being inexperienced over deceitful, but only someone involved can figure that out.<p>Equity is the bonus (lottery ticket) used to convince people to take a chance on an unknown company with unknown founders, it is not compensation initially.  98% (a number totally pulled out of my ass but based on my experiences) of the time equity will be worthless.  That said, if things are still fun &amp; worth it then you join and forget about the equity unless you fully vest and the company has an exit or the equity becomes marketable in another way (secondary market etc).  Also, that doesn&#x27;t mean you shouldn&#x27;t try to get more equity as you go, especially if things are going well, extra grants is a way to help make it more of a real event for you in that rare 1-2% chance it works out. Also extra equity is the only way to offset the dilution each raise will bring you.<p>I have seen founders try to say your compensation is your (salary + (vested equity * current valuation)) or some variation of that.  That is just a way to try and convince inexperienced people that they are being compensated fairly.  No one has a clue what the valuation will be when the equity becomes marketable or at an exit, it may even be negative (liabilities &gt; assets).  You have no way of paying bills by telling the bank you own 1% of &quot;ABC SaaS startup&quot;, no one is loaning you money against it etc.  And even if someone did loan you money that way, that is still not compensation it is trading on your credit&#x2F;reputation not the companies.<p>If you got paid $80k this year by the startup, that&#x27;s your compensation, period.  Only you can say whether you feel what is going on is fair.  If it is fair and you like the place, stick it out, if it isn&#x27;t be ready to find your next gig and use this experience to set yourself up differently next time.<p>BTW -- I am definitely not negative on startups, I just believe people should know the facts and likely outcomes so there isn&#x27;t a misunderstanding or someone feeling taken advantage of at some point.",,

For example, * ppX is a perfect valid expression for a pointer to a pointer named ppX, as in:<p><pre><code>    int **ppX;

So you need to use an expression where the declared variable is used <i>that results in a non-pointer type</i>.

The protocol is here [1] and I think anyone with suitable equipment (an RT-PCR machine and an oligonucleotide synthesizer to make the primers and probes?) could run tests using just the information on that web page, though they would probably also want known positive samples of the virus to validate against. And there are lots of labs with suitable equipment. But as that page says, it is not legal to do this clinically.<p>The CDC also sent out test kits [2]. These are just vials of primer&#x2F;probe pairs synthesized from the short sequences on the above page, and a fake positive control to validate with. These were authorized by the FDA, and so are legal to use. But apparently somehow they screwed up the production of primer #3 (or maybe the sequence itself is wrong), and so almost all the labs were not able to validate the test.

(I actually pay ~$8 a month for it, but I don&#x27;t have to.)<p>I used to watch episodes of Star Trek when they aired, and if I missed it, I just had to wait a few months until it aired again. (Often, football aired immediately before and it would run overtime, so they&#x27;d just start Star Trek partway through the episode.) Also, if the signal was super-staticy, you could play with the antenna for a while, but most likely, you just lived with it.<p>Now, I can go watch whichever episode I want at any point, static-free. It&#x27;s not free (unless I pirate it), but it&#x27;s included in an annual subscription I already had for other purposes (free shipping).<p>We (my family) used to spend hours hunting through used bookstores. There were various books by my favorite authors I never found, despite dozens (hundreds?) of hours searching through dozens (hundreds?) of used book stores.<p>Now I can go buy them online and have them in a couple days, or if they&#x27;re available as ebooks, a few seconds. A few years ago, I was waiting at a bus stop, and decided I wanted to re-read one of my favorite books. I promptly downloaded it and was reading it before the bus arrived.<p>My parents had (actually...have) a large cabinet to store their records and tapes.

Because of its viral nature, anyone with different licensing must convert to GPL if they use your code. For many scenarios, this is actually not possible not just because of commercial secrets but the potential for opening up for security vulnerabilities when you don’t have resources or competitions where you should keep code secret until some time or simply because you have dependencies on other code which is very expensive to get rid off. Due to this reason, many companies forbid the use of GPL licensed software as well as release anything under it (because then you can’t use your own code!). Many other companies simply don&#x27;t want the headache of checking all of their mess of legacy codebases with a myriad of dependencies that would be hard to untangle into GPL compatible open-source release.

But the same issue holds if we do 100 studies, and reject null for 5 of them.  One of the fundamental problems with p values is that we don&#x27;t really know the baseline number of things being compared in unpublished and preliminary research, which in turn makes the p value somewhat meaningless.<p>In effect, we&#x27;ve unfairly penalized the study with multiple comparisons vs. the same findings showing up from studies with individual comparisons.<p>* Studies with multiple comparisons are great engines of hypothesis generation.

If you are likely to be in close contact with someone infected, a mask cuts the chance of the disease being passed on.

22453818,psnively,1583017240,22410498,"Thanks, and good question.<p>I deliberately didn&#x27;t go into the specifics about the various typeclasses at play and their laws, and how those are tested. Part of that is just for reasons of time, but the more salient reason is that I wanted to show how those of us who do purely functional programming do it in practice. So if you watched the presentation, you saw that most of my thinking was about &quot;OK, how do I elaborate from the most trivial transformation (do nothing at all) to the one I really want?&quot; And that proceeds compositionally: I transform this value to that value. OK, does that value have the right type? No? What do I need to do to ensure that it does? And the transformation steps have some important properties, like their scope being entirely local. I really tried to emphasize this at the end with `attemptRepeatedly`: my description of each line of the whopping three lines is exhaustive. When I say there&#x27;s no point in writing a test for it, I mean that literally. There certainly are typeclasses at play, and I briefly talk about the `Catchable` typeclass, and show the ScalaDoc for it, which documents an important law: the relationship between catching ambient exceptions and the algebra provided by `Catchable`. I rely on the other typeclasses and other laws in a similar fashion.<p>The other thing I think is pretty important is the part where I say &quot;Let&#x27;s look at cases,&quot; because the point there is that I can reason about the code by reasoning about the shape of the data it&#x27;s manipulating. So if a `step` is an `attempt` of `p` that, if successful, `kill`s the retry `schedule` or, if unsuccessful, logs the exception, I&#x27;m still dealing with a `Process` of one element (by assumption that `p` will emit one element). Then `retries` will be a `Process` of 0 to infinity elements, because we put no constraints on `schedule`. So `(step ++ retries)` will be one or more elements, and because `step` `kill`s `schedule` on success, because `retries` is derived from `schedule`, `retries` is also `kill`ed. So `(step ++ retries)` is a `Process` that will emit one or more elements, with the last element being the first successful one, or the last failed element if none of the `retries` succeeds, so we take `last`. Then we just `fold` the failure or value back into a single effect, and we&#x27;re done.<p>As I discuss in the presentation, there certainly are questions. What happens if the `schedule` is empty? What happens if the `schedule` is infinite? An attendee in Q &amp; A asked a really good question: was I sure `retries` would wait before the first retry, or was the semantics &quot;try, then wait?&quot; (It really is the former, but that wasn&#x27;t clear from my recorded REPL session.)<p>Of course, this isn&#x27;t very impressive for a three-line example, although I think it&#x27;s pretty striking that it only takes three lines, each of which can be completely reasoned about independently, to achieve a pretty significant operational goal. The point, though, is we can build entire systems this way, and in fact `attemptRepeatedly` is part of a distributed monitoring system I worked on at Intel Media&#x2F;Verizon Labs, which is written entirely in this way apart from the monitoring types themselves, which present an imperative API for familiarity&#x27;s sake (and which we later came to regret).<p>I hope this helps!",,

Recently there have been several tragic deaths of young doctors in Wuhan from covid19, including the 29-year-old Dr. Xia Sisi, the 29-year-old Dr. Peng Yin Hua, the 42-year-old Dr. Huang Wenjun, and of course the 34-year-old Dr. Li Wenliang. This is at some odds with general population data showing that deaths of covid19 tend to be highly concentrated in the elderly. It could be a statistical anomaly, but it does seem like death rates may be higher in young doctors than would be expected in the population.<p>As an explanation, many of the most upvoted comments on these posts suggest that their immune systems might be suppressed due to overwork, poor sleep, and stress. To me, this seems to be an extremely unlikely explanation for many reasons, including the fact that doctors don&#x27;t seem to die at relatively higher rates of other infectious illnesses such as influenza.<p>However, some people have mentioned higher viral load as a possibility, which seemed more likely. I did some research and I found this 2005 study on the role of viral load in SARS (which is, of course, very similar to covid19): <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wwwnc.cdc.gov&#x2F;eid&#x2F;article&#x2F;11&#x2F;12&#x2F;pdfs&#x2F;04-0949.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wwwnc.cdc.gov&#x2F;eid&#x2F;article&#x2F;11&#x2F;12&#x2F;pdfs&#x2F;04-0949.pdf</a><p>The study looked at an outbreak of sars in a particular housing area in Hong Kong. They found that people who had closer contact with the index patient had a higher nasopharyngeal viral load on admission as measured by RT-PCR. Crucially, they also found that people in this area were also the most likely to die. Some quotes:<p>&quot;The median nasopharyngeal viral load in E block patients (5.09 log10 copies&#x2F;mL) was much higher than in non-E block patients (0 log10 copies&#x2F;mL) on admission (p&lt;0.001)... The overall case death rate among the 79 patients was 24.1%. The highest rate was in block E, which accounted for 79% of all deaths, while the death rate in patients living in E7 (the same block as the index patient) was 70% (7 patients). This rate is significantly higher than in other units (p = 0.001 by χ2 test). The index patient was one of the few patients from E7 who survived the disease.&quot;<p>&quot;Severity of illness did not differ between block E patients and non-E block patients when they were first seen at the hospital, despite higher viral load in block E patients. However, the death rate was higher in block E. We have previously demonstrated that patients with high initial and peak viral loads in nasopharyngeal samples were more likely to show a less favorable disease course and lower survival rate (8,18). Patients living in E7 who had highest nasopharyngeal viral loads explains why their death rate was higher than for those living in other units. The dilution effect resulted in a decreased viral load as the disease spread to other units and in a lower death rate.&quot;<p>This data corroborates the viral load theory. It&#x27;s not perfect evidence, but the theory also makes basic physiologic sense. A higher viral load on initial infection means that the virus will be able to do more damage and suppress the host&#x27;s immune system further (lymphopenia) before the host can mount an immune response against the virus.<p>Hospital workers are likely to be exposed to especially high viral loads of covid19. People who are hospitalized with covid19 infections are likely to cough more and require close contact for procedures such as IV placement and intubation. It is hard to know for sure, but healthcare transmission risk may have been especially high in the early stages of the epidemic in Wuhan, when people were not as aware of the high mortality rates of this disease.<p>If viral load upon initial infection correlates with disease severity, this may also help to explain why some local clusters seem to have more severe disease, such as the family who all died of the disease. For some reason, people in these clusters may have been exposed to an especially high viral load. Ideally, we could measure the viral load of infected people with RT-PCR to test this, although it&#x27;s hard enough to get basic yes&#x2F;no tests for covid19 at this point.<p>The viral load theory is not rock solid. It may not explain a large percentage of the variance in disease severity - certainly age seems to be a larger factor. But to me, it is clearly the leading theory why a disproportionate number of young doctors without apparent pre-existing health problems have died of covid19 in Wuhan.<p>Healthcare workers putting themselves at risk to care for the sick during this pandemic are heroes. It is an urgent priority to have sufficient PPE available to our healthcare staff. We also need to have adequate space available to allow for the adequate distancing of staff and possibly infected patients. The viral load theory suggests that PPE and distancing are not only important for preventing healthcare workers from getting the illness but also decreasing the likelihood that they will die of the illness if they are infected.

We live in Argentina and we lived 1 year in the USA in the middle.<p>She was totally asymptomatic, and was tested because she has hypothyroidism and it seems it&#x27;s pretty common that both conditions come together. So, the doc ordered the tests: first a blood analysis that came positive, then an endoscopy to confirm. From what I&#x27;ve heard here, for every diagnosed person, there&#x27;s about 8 people who have not been diagnosed. But at least here, health professionals are getting aware and more people is getting properly diagnosed nowadays.<p>Luckily for us, Argentina is a very celiac friendly country. A few years ago (coincidentally, about the time my wife was diagnosed), a law was passed that demands all products to inform if they contain gluten or not, and there&#x27;s A LOT of gluten free products available everywhere that are identified by a standardized logo.<p>In Buenos Aires, there&#x27;s a lot of restaurants selling exclusively gluten free food, and for the rest, almost everyone has gluten free options.  Many of those, even design a separate space in their kitchens and utensils for gluten free food, to ensure there won&#x27;t be cross-contamination.  I believe this was achieved thanks to the free courses and consultancy given by 2 NGOs founded by celiac people.<p>As for the difficulty to educate other people about this, I believe it happens mostly with older people, as it was not a commonly diagnosed disease not long ago, so... sometimes they might at first look with suspicion or disbelief, but then after explaining them exactly what&#x27;s about.. they understand, but need to be reminded anyways.   So, if it&#x27;s family, it&#x27;s better for the first months&#x2F;years to take your own food when visiting them, or helping them to cook, as it&#x27;s a perfect opportunity to teach them.<p>One of my best friend&#x27;s daughter was diagnosed when she was a 18 months old baby (she felt badly, was having trouble gaining weight, etc). She is now 4 years old, and super healthy after following a gluten free diet since then. You&#x27;d think it would be hard for her... but it&#x27;s incredible when other kids offer her something, she immediately looks the package for the logo, if she does not see it, she politely rejects it (or if unpackaged, she simply asks if it&#x27;s gluten free), as she knows it would harm her otherwise...   Her kindergarten teachers are aware and pay attention other kids won&#x27;t contaminate her food, so all has been OK so far.<p>In our home, we usually have for dinner the same food, but for some stuff like pasta or pizza, I usually cook my food separated from hers, as I prefer the &quot;regular&quot; wheat pasta. She does not have trouble with it. So, in those specific cases it&#x27;s a little more work when cleaning the pans, but that&#x27;s not much of a problem.<p>I hope this was helpful!",[22454086],

But even beyond that, power is at stake. Climate change isn&#x27;t about science, it&#x27;s about geopolitics&#x2F;globalism. It&#x27;s about instilling fear to create a global political system. At least that&#x27;s my take. If the climate change alarmism was valid, we&#x27;d simply end global trade today because global trade is the driver of pollution. But you never hear that from the elites. They demand more globalism, but with a global tax. Maybe a global system is the next step of human societal evolution, but instead of being open and honest and having a global discussion, these people are being sneaky and using fear to sneak a global system on humanity.<p>&gt; There would seem to be a very strong incentive to show existing models are not accurate or to come up with scientifically plausible models with very different outcomes.<p>Not if enough of those with money and power are aligned on one side. Then there is very strong incentive to show one side.<p>&gt; The supposed political reasons for supporting or being against climate change theories do not change the facts.<p>Sure. And the facts are that climate science is a very young science and have been reliably wrong that we shouldn&#x27;t take it as gospel. Especially when so much of climate science is politically driven.<p>I love climate change alarmism. When their predictions are wrong, they claim that the climate is so complex that it&#x27;s hard to model and predict accurately. At the same time, they claim their predictions are facts and we must believe everything they say. Even when these alarmists all say and have different predictions. How about this, how out of dozens&#x2F;hundreds of climate alarmist models, which is the right one?<p>I personally believe that climate change is natural and the forces of nature ( mostly the sun ) drive climate on earth. Also, I don&#x27;t think there is anything we can do about climate change, just like we can&#x27;t do anything about earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. And I reject the false notion that climate change is bad. Climate change can be bad for some, but good for others.<p>If climate alarmists want to be taken seriously, then let them protest globalist bankers and global trade instead of advocating for a global carbon tax and enriching the wealthy bankers and industrialists. But of course they won&#x27;t because these climate alarmists are funded by the globalist bankers and industrialists.",[22454068],

Although I do not have celiac my sister does and I grew up in a household where I couldn&#x27;t put butter on toast and then go for a second dab of butter. Here are a few tips of advice from what my sister has done, and what our family does.<p>&gt; At restaurants or family gatherings my sister would always say, &quot;I am allergic to gluten&quot; in place of &quot;I have celiac disease. An allergy is within the experience of most people, particularly in severe cases like some peanut allergies. In this way the waitresses and family members often ask about severity, in which she mentions nothing that touches gluten should be used to prep her food and that washing a set of utensils is best.<p>&gt; A second restaurant protocol is asking whether a salad, piece of meat, or other dish has coatings, dressings, or bread accoutrements. Grilled chicken and steak are my sisters favorite as when she asks if they are coated in flour the answer is always &#x27;no&#x27;. When salads or soups come with bread or croutons she asks for them to be removed when ordering.<p>&gt; When a dish comes with a loaf of bread, croutons, or other gluten items we weren&#x27;t able to discern from the menu or the waitress, she usually asks for one of us to remove it and eat it, if the contamination was small. Knowing how you react to small amounts trace gluten is the key here.<p>&gt; Create a shelf at home that contains only gluten free food. We have several now, but first began with a shelf in the fridge for only gluten free foods and leftovers and a pantry shelf. If not that, have pieces of tape to mark items of food that have no gluten anything that helps in indicate to others what it is and is for. &quot;Use the pasta with the tape on it for my dish because I am allergic to normal pasta&quot; is easier to relate to others.<p>A final thought, make it a point to go out to eat and explore food with your family! They&#x27;ll only grow comfortable to you asking questions of the food if they are exposed to it repeatedly. My family always looks at the menu&#x27;s ahead of going to a restaurant, but even at the most bread heavy of spots she finds a salad, soup, or steak that suits her desires.<p>Don&#x27;t worry too much and know that it won&#x27;t ruin all eating for you!

We need a 24&#x2F;7 managed presence on the Internet. We need to be able to accept payments. We have statutory obligations to file government returns and pay our taxes.

Despite their critical nature, even the services we use for these things have often have let us down in ways that significantly damaged the business affected.<p>There are a handful of things where some non-critical functionality is much improved by using an external service.

Firstly, given that it&#x27;s almost certain that any you&#x27;re getting for free could drop you and discard your data&#x2F;infrastructure&#x2F;whatever with little if any notice, do you actually know what would happen to your critical operations in each case if they did? And secondly, do you have a plan for how to almost immediately restore anything critical that you would lose in each case? I would guess that the answers for a lot of small businesses with excessive dependencies are not going to be pretty, and that those businesses are also wilfully concealing significant risks from customers who are relying on them.<p>You could reasonable certainly argue that all of my businesses are relatively modest in size, and that we might have given up on some opportunities by not using more of these tools. I would counter that all of my businesses are also still in business, and in some cases now run by just a handful of people working on them part-time, and that is partly because we have such low overheads in terms of maintaining all of those services and dealing with unwanted changes or outages.

However, if you have reason to think you&#x27;re going to do something questionable (such as, say, have the part of the family that doesn&#x27;t really keep the gluten separate, or go out to eat somewhere), I&#x27;m about 99% confident this stuff really does work and can help, even if it doesn&#x27;t &quot;solve&quot; the problem. You can even take it an hour after you eat, once you realize what has happened, and it will still help. Won&#x27;t solve everything. But it helps. Sometimes the &quot;use by&quot; dates are very conservative on things; for these I&#x27;ve found these do tend to go bad quickly, and they may cause minor digestive distress downstairs, if you know what I mean; still worth it.<p>Three: In my personal experience, the <i>real</i> problem with celiac isn&#x27;t &quot;I feel ill when I eat wheat.&quot; That is, ultimately, just an inconvenience. The <i>real</i> problem in my life is that I have difficulty absorbing nutrients, even after I&#x27;ve long since stopped eating wheat. My big challenge has been what I&#x27;m fairly sure is &quot;paroxysmal atrial fibrillation&quot;, which I didn&#x27;t realize was trashing my sleep for years, to the point where I couldn&#x27;t even get to sleep anymore without my heart doing all the things (PVCs, skipped beats, hard beats, bleh). The doctors I went to declined to diagnose me, but it worked out because they&#x27;d probably have thrown pills at me. I now take fistfuls of vitamins several times a day. It looks rather scary, but for me has been a life changer in a good way, and when I don&#x27;t do it, I immediately suffer. I would advise reading up about vitamins and minerals and their various symptoms of deficiencies, and considering trying some of them if any of them strike you as relevant to your life. In general, a place like HN will say that supplements should generally not be necessary and you should just eat well, and while I <i>generally</i> agree with that, you <i>specifically</i> have strong Bayesian evidence to consider that you may find certain supplements may help you a lot.<p>As far as I know, while there are studies that establish the general truth of what I&#x27;ve said above, there are not very many <i>specific</i> studies that discuss which nutrients you are specifically likely to be missing. My <i>personal</i> experience is that I really seem to have trouble with the minerals, though I&#x27;ve also had good experience with taurine (with its friend l-arginine, heart related), vitamin A (didn&#x27;t help my heart but it gave my immune system a <i>huge</i> kick in a good way), and vitamin K (with its friend D). YMMV. If you specifically have a heart issue, reach out to me (see HN profile) and I can get more detailed; it&#x27;s a bit long to put on HN. If you don&#x27;t specifically have that issue, you&#x27;ll have to explore on your own. Or maybe you have it relatively lightly compared to me; my father has a much less strong version of it and does fine on a small subset of what I have to take.

She must carry an epi pen and even the slightest cross contamination can make her very very sick for several days.<p>We considered this together and it comes down to a few things. First, remove all contaminants from your home and if anyone MUST have wheat, give them a separate cupboard and make sure they know exactly now to not cross contaminate. I had to learn this after much repetition. When I make a sandwich on wheat bread, I use about 2x the dishes (spoons etc) than I did before and I wash my hands about a half dozen times.<p>For others, explain glitter. It gets everywhere. The only way to not get glitter on yourself is to go where there is no glitter. Tell them to imagine that their hands, utensils, pans, etc are covered in glitter. Until it&#x27;s been washed by something that&#x27;s glitter free, then whatever touches it will have glitter on it. Except this glitter can kill.<p>Regarding finding a place to eat, be careful- there&#x27;s places that have gluten free items, but pay no attention to cross contamination, and then there are places that simply ARE gluten free and have no gluten. The main question to ask: &quot;Do you have a separate preparation and cooking area for gluten free food?&quot; If the answer is no, move on. Call ahead, and plan you excursions based on these areas.

You need to be an expert on what has gluten in it. If you go to a restaurant, you can ask to see ingredient lists, and it&#x27;s up to YOU to determine if there is wheat. Most food industry people are not trained in this. We once asked if food had gluten in it and got a &quot;No&quot; after they looked at the ingredients. When we examined them ourselves, it plainly said &quot;flour&quot; on it. Flour, unless specified to be GF, is wheat.<p>All of this research can be done online. Be the expert, and save yourself time and frustration. Also, be bold! If you get a &#x27;rolleyes&#x27; from a server when you ask about GF food, that&#x27;s a good sign to just walk out. Unfortunately there are many for whom GF is a fad and they treat it like it makes them cooler than everybody else. They have done a lot of damage for Celiacs, but don&#x27;t be afraid to set yourself apart from them. &quot;I know it might seem difficult, but if I my daughter gets gluten, she goes into anaphylactic shock, has to epi pen herself and then spend the night in the ER. She could die.&quot;<p>My daughter sometimes sets her epi pen next to her! One server brought her a salad with croutons on it- when my daughter explained the problem, she simply picked the croutons off and brought it back!

If however, the leaders are charlatans, then more competent underlings will stop respecting or listening to the leaders, and&#x2F;or may challenge the leaders. Typically life is worse off (for society as a whole) under bad leaders than good leaders.<p>This is why bottom up respect speaks volume to the success of a team.

Among her peers, you’ll hear, variously expressed, a very basic sentiment: finally, a First Lady who’s one of us. “It was just as if we’d known each other all our lives,” says Carly Simon, who has spent time at Martha’s Vineyard with the First Lady; when Hillary admired a naïve Haitian painting in Simon’s house, Simon made a present of it. “It was an easy, Ivy League kind of camaraderie. Like, ‘You went to Wellesley? Oh, I went to Sarah Lawrence.’ And, ‘Oh, you like that kind of art? I like that kind of art.’ ” But if you do not feel part of that “us”—if, indeed, the very idea of Haitian folk art on the Vineyard makes you shift uneasily—you may feel the tug of an answering sentiment: that this First Lady is <i>one of them</i>.<p>Both this <i>Quillette</i> piece and the <i>New Yorker</i> article are presaged and, in my opinion, upstaged by Hayek&#x27;s 1960 diatribe &quot;The Intellectuals and Socialism&quot;:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;Intellectuals%20and%20Socialism_4.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;Intellectuals%20and%20S...</a><p>Hayek&#x27;s piece seems to me to be the founding treatise of modern libertarianism, with regard to the parts that are valuable at least.

Unfortunately, Hayek himself simply became increasingly cynical and decreasingly coherent towards the end of his life, after publishing his most famous works from a more moderate perspective, so we didn&#x27;t get to hear a conclusion to this train of thought.<p>It&#x27;s not obvious how to overcome this limitation; all ideologies need a base of support, and people on average tend to be selfish enough that we notice it. Andrew Yang&#x27;s proposal to give citizens money earmarked for political donations (<i>&quot;Democracy Dollars&quot;</i>) seems, to me, the most practical step currently available towards making politics more participatory and less hierarchical: it can foster the growth of competition among political campaigns for ordinary people&#x27;s support with floating prices, reminiscent of a system we usually think of as reliable.

Like many projects that originate from Google, it always struck me as a solution looking for a problem.<p>The first &quot;problem&quot; was Javscript.<p>At one presentation about this I recall that Lars Bak (IIRC) took quite a beating about DArt, just in terms of the questions asked, to the point that someone had to point out just how much he&#x27;d accomplished (ie V8). This was, in essence, an appeal to authority.<p>I recall the Ads PA basically stepping in to save the project. I can only speculate why but my best guess is the AdWords TL woke up one day and decided to rewrite AdWords in Dart (as he allegedly had with GWT some years before). But all that&#x27;s pure speculation.<p>The second &quot;problem&quot; that Dart solved was using the same code on client and server, something Google is inexplicably obsessed with (eg GWT). I don&#x27;t know what caveats came with Dart but GWT had plenty (eg for many years it wasn&#x27;t possible to use the same protobuf classes on client and server).<p>I believe the intent with Dart was, at one point, to run natively within Chrome (the article mentions Dartium). This worked out really well for vbscript. No one wants to write different languages for different browsers. Again, I speculate here, but my strong suspicion is the Chrome team killed the idea of shipping a Dart VM in Chrome and that was the end of that.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s just me but TypeScript just seemed far more sane.<p>So... Flutter. I don&#x27;t know why a UI library needs to be language-specific but it strikes me as a bad idea. Now, the counterpoint is that Flutter is an SDK And more akin to, say, React Native (albeit with significant architectural differences) but I don&#x27;t think it started that way.<p>:UI frameworks, libraries and SDKs just don&#x27;t seem to be in Google&#x27;s wheelhouse (as opposed to, say, infra, which very much does).

Eg, fish or a meat and mashed potatoes with a side of veggies is super healthy, gluten free, and super good.  Or, if you like more Asian tasting foods, you can make a curry and instead of over rice do it over quinoa.  Quinoa is cooked the exact same way as white rice, in a rice cooker, but it can be cooked with broth, not just water, which allows the quinoa to be paired to the meal.  Eg, beef broth quinoa + thai yellow curry chicken can taste better than with rice.<p>In the US there are tons of gluten free options in super markets, from gluten free hamburger and hotdog bus to gluten free dinner roles, and within the last 5 years or so some of the new gluten free breads are shocking.  You wouldn&#x27;t know they&#x27;re gluten free.  Out here they tend to be in the freezer section instead of with the normal bread because they&#x27;ll go bad quickly.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if there is any Whole Foods or similar in Luthuania but you can probably find supermarkets with the same mentality.  Basically, find the most expensive grocery store in the nearest decent sized city near you and you can start there to see what kind of options exist in that area.  There are good gluten free bread options, at least on this side of the world.<p>My great grandmother had Celiac&#x27;s, so I grew up on a lot of gluten free home cooking.  After decades of being on a safe diet (she never cared to eat out to begin with) her Celiac&#x27;s died down and towards the end of her life she started to be able to eat gluten again, but we limited it to one meal a week, just in case.<p>Back then, all gluten free bread was home made.  This is always an option if super markets are limited.  If companies can make absurdly good gluten free bread today, then there are probably recipes out there just as good, but they may be hard to find.<p>So that covers the three basics: rice alternative, non-gluten by default meals (potato or similar is usually involved), and gluten free breads.<p>If you&#x27;ve got fresh cod (or similar) around you, I&#x27;d recommend starting with gluten free beer battered fish &#x27;n chips.  Making home made french fries is a lot of fun too, but can be a bit of work.

Home made breads will consistantly beat the pants off of most commercial ones; the only problem you may find in Lithuania is availability of gluten free &quot;cup for cup&quot; baking flours, but if you can&#x27;t find them readily, you can substitute most flours by weight into a standard recipe.<p>Some notes on gf flours, you will never get the rise you would out of bread flours because they&#x27;re missing the biggest ingredient for rise, gluten.  But you can get pretty darn close with your own sourdough mother made out of a mix of other flours.  My usual mix includes some combination of:<p><pre><code>  - white rice flour
  - brown rice flour
  - tapioca starch
  - almond or teff flour
  - xanthan gum, guar gum, or amaranth gum as the gluten substitute
  - powdered egg whites also as gluten substitute
</code></pre>
You&#x27;re going to need to experiment, but getting a good all purpose mix will make a night and day difference in the gluten free life.<p>As for countries that are &quot;better&quot; for gluten free, I would hazard a guess that many asian countries are going to be better just due to their lack of reliance on gluten heavy grains as dietary staples.

22454890,gavinray,1583032600,22454649,"This is a complicated answer that would probably take experience developing real-world applications in both to fully appreciate, but I`ll bite.<p>A few years ago, I was CTO of a small startup and spent a significant portion of a year building out our mobile app in React Native.<p>I have experience building cross-platform mobile apps going all the way back from when Ionic was called Apache PhoneGap and was an entirely different product.<p>In my opinion, React Native is a classic case of follow-the-herd syndrome. This is not to say that React Native is not a viable technology, but simply that it just isn&#x27;t very <i>good</i>. Let me dive into a few of the things that were really grating when developing on RN:<p>- The hot-reload times were painstakingly slow. I am talking about 15-20 seconds after save. This really takes a toll on development velocity.<p>- You have a major decision to make when building an RN app: To use Expo or not. Expo is an SDK which allows you to circumvent needing to drop down into the native build processes for each platform and provides wrapper APIs for accessing native hardware functionality on the phone, with the tradeoff being that a wide number of RN libraries were not compatible since they required being installed as Cocoa Pods or Gradle&#x2F;Maven packages natively. So you are trading convenience and development speed for flexibility. We chose to go with Expo, and did not regret it.<p>- Performance is an issue in RN that you need to aggressively optimize against. I remember being aghast that rendering a scrollable list of 300 text items caused so much lag and stuttering it required a full day of manual optimization to calculate viewport area and which cells would be in view to prevent that work from being done by the element on-thread in order to be semi-usable. You have to be really cautious about your render cycles and everything else when building views.<p>- Doing heavy custom styling requires some hacky workarounds since RN wraps the native UI elements and does not expose all of the style API that they provide.<p>Later on, at another company, we ended up building an app with NativeScript + Vue which was a much better experience. NativeScript is essentially React Native, but allows you to use any JS&#x2F;TS framework (or none at all) and has much better APIs for interacting with the device, and allows you to fully style the underlying device-specific UI element if you really need to. And the performance ran circles around RN. The entire experience was overall miles better. Very few people use NativeScript though, just due to the fact you never hear about it.<p>Ultimately, if I had to give advice, it would be this:<p>Either write a regular PWA web app, so that you can leverage existing web technologies and all the component libraries, and then add native functionalities and publish to the app store using the Capacitor framework that powers Ionic apps. Or just use Flutter.<p>Flutter has the only cross-platform mobile experience that does not feel really hacky to me. It does not try to compile to platform-specific view elements, instead compiling to native ARM code, and tries to maintain 120FPS. You can use the same Flutter codebase to generate mobile, web, and desktop apps. And the whole developer experience is really incredible. Instant stateful hot-reloading, screaming performance. Google put a lot of effort and thought into it, and Flutter is not going anywhere given that it powers all of Fuschias UI.","[22455118, 22455212]",

Maybe you&#x27;d heard one song from the album on the radio, maybe you had heard other stuff by the band, or maybe you just bought it because the cover artwork looked cool or you&#x27;d heard the name of the band somewhere.  $20 for a CD, and you just hoped it&#x27;d turn out to be something you liked because that would be the only new music you heard until you bought another one.<p>Movies were similar.  On TV, there was a blurb in TV guide, at the rental store, a blurb on the back of the box, and at the theater, just a poster.  That&#x27;s all you knew about it until you watched it, which could be awhile.  Now, you hear of a potentially interesting movie and you can instantly read cast, summary, reviews, and links to related movies.  If you&#x27;re still interested, you can be watching it inside of 5 minutes, with subtitles.<p>Also mobile connectivity consisted of your beeper going off, then you stopping whatever you were doing, going to find a payphone, calling the number and hoping whoever beeped you was still waiting for you to call in and that you could get through the call before you ran out of quarters.<p>We had internet then, but mostly used local BBSes, and it was still dialup at 1200 or 2400 bps, all text mode.  You watched the text scroll onto your screen as it downloaded.<p>And big difference - no multitasking.  If you were chatting on IRC, that&#x27;s all you were doing.  You didn&#x27;t have other windows, so there was no chatting about something you were doing in another window.  You weren&#x27;t talking on the phone and couldn&#x27;t get calls because the modem was using the line.  You wouldn&#x27;t get emails until you closed IRC and opened your email client.<p>But that leads into the negatives.<p>No anticipation.  Hinted at above, you looked forward to getting a new CD on payday, or getting home to see that movie that you&#x27;d rented, or your favorite show that came on on Fridays, or hanging out with friends on the weekend.  Now that you can access any of that any time, there&#x27;s not much to look forward to.<p>Related, time has lost much of its flavor.  Back then you could tell time by whatever theme song you&#x27;d heard most recently, or the type of show playing on the TV in the background.  Different days had different lineups, so family sitcom night had a different flavor than back-to-back horror movie night.  24-hour on-demand makes all time equal and flavorless in that sense.  Modern connectivity also means you can work from home in the middle of the night, find people to talk to online, shop online for anything, so even the difference between night and day has lost some flavor.<p>And most of all, we&#x27;ve lost downtime.  It takes a conscious effort now to unplug, have nothing to do, and get bored.  In the past, that was when we would hang out with friends, read long-form books, go for a walk and explore, observe the world around us, strike up a conversation with strangers, learn new things or try new hobbies, be creative and imaginative.  But now that we&#x27;re drinking from the firehose, it takes real effort to get bored, or to relax.  We do a lot less of all those things now, and it has a psychological and social impact.",,

The documenting might be in adding code comments and API docs, writing separate text files, etc.  The person might not be able to document off-the-cuff, but have to work through a topic slowly, such as going through and re-understanding some old code themselves, going through a manual process that they do automatically and reflecting on the whys, etc.<p>* If some of the information is amenable to giving a talk to other employees, with a Q&amp;A section, that might work, too.<p>* Another option is to have another employee interview the person leaving about one or more topics, and either type notes as they go, or record it and get a transcription.  The interviewing person should be able to understand the topics.<p>* For tasks the person leaving does, you could have other people do the tasks <i>while the person leaving is available for questions</i>, and one of them documents as it goes.  Depending on the task, it might make sense to have the knowledge-holder right there, both answering <i>and observing</i>, rather than only available for questions on-demand.<p>Side suggestion about accessibility&#x2F;discoverability&#x2F;maintainability of all this new documentation: consider keeping the medium simple, and avoiding a proliferation of locations, formats, a dozen bullpoop communication SaaSes, etc.  For most software work, for example, inline embedded source code comments and API docs can be an easy way to try to keep a lot of information accessible in context and maintained.  Some other information that doesn&#x27;t fit well in source code, such as ops architecture and procedures, might be Markdown files in that same code repo, or another one.  The occasional video file you just can&#x27;t check into git might be a rare indispensible one, but can still be linked from a Markdown file that&#x27;s in your repo, but even then, maybe you also have a text transcript in the repo, or someone turns a talk into edited docs in the repo.<p>Incidentally, much earlier in organizational knowledge sharing, I vaguely recall a study by a consulting firm (sorry, no cite handy, and I&#x27;m not 100% sure I remember which big-name firm), in which they found that people were resistant to having their knowledge captured in a system, because that knowledge was an asset of the individual.  Your key people leaving might be more altruistic than that, want to help out their colleagues, want to have a good word-of-mouth reputation, have a sense of professionalism about it, have equity in the company, etc.  You might like them to do knowledge transfer to a degree that&#x27;s really above&amp;beyond the call, so consider how you might acknowledge and thank them for that.

22455269,briantakita,1583040138,22454979,"&gt; Repeated failure to predict at the expected probability of your error bars would falsify the model. (i.e. commit to what your model is, then run it with now known inputs after the fact)<p>That doesn&#x27;t help if you are not gathering the correct proxy data to represent the actual physical system. For example, CMIP6 includes particle forcing while CMIP5 &amp; before did not. The global &amp; solar electric circuits are not considered. Are xrays, which have a large variance with solar cycles, included in CMIP6? I don&#x27;t think the Birkeland Current is considered.<p>What also doesn&#x27;t help is adjusting historical measurements such as temperature. It&#x27;s like changing the rules mid-game, which indicates that past observations are mutable to fit the models. Also note the incomplete data, as modern satellite observations span a tiny window compared to Earth&#x27;s lifespan. The solar system travels through different parts of the Galaxy, crossing the Galactic Current Sheet at times, passing through ionized dust, among other phenomena.<p>&gt; Sadly, our ability to experiment repeatedly in the same conditions with the environment is deeply limited, in a way much akin to astronomy.<p>We can experiment with ions, plasma, &amp; high voltages applied to plasma. Note the Birkeland Current between Sun &amp; the Earth, ions being ejected from the Sun, XRay emission varying wildly with solar activity, cosmic rays, etc. There&#x27;s also a Birkeland current sheet in the solar system &amp; a galactic current sheet.<p>One of the major issues is that the standard model does not consider plasma &amp; electricity, in light of recent observations of the prevalence of Plasma in space, effectively blinding large parts of the astronomical theory to it&#x27;s impact. This led to a legacy of ad hoc, non-observable (thus non-falsifiable) inventions such as &quot;dark matter&quot;, &quot;dark energy&quot;, &quot;black holes&quot;, &quot;neutron stars&quot;, &quot;the big bang&quot;, &quot;space&#x2F;time&quot;, &quot;magnetic line snapping&quot;, &quot;parallel universes&quot;, &quot;11 dimension space&quot; &amp; whatever other mathematical patches are used to fit the observations. Note inconsistencies with the assertion that redshift equals distance with observations such as examples of a Quasar with a high redshift being connected to a Galaxy with a low redshift.<p>Point is climate science is built on a tower of assumptions built on assumptions where some of the foundational pieces are called into question. Ad hoc tweaking of observational data &amp; ad hoc tweaking of models to fit the transformed observed measurements makes it easy to doubt the accuracy, predictive ability, &amp; knowledge of applicable boundary conditions of the model.

For many complex systems and differential equations, modern solution techniques such as finite element, finite difference, and finite volume methods provide superior performance and model fidelity.  Many equations such as those for fluid dynamics can not be solved analytically and must be solved using a numerical method.<p>Now, if a differential equation is linear, after discretization, it can essentially be boiled down to a linear system such as Ax=b.  The dynamics can be found in the linear operator A and the forcing term is b.  We&#x27;re interested in x.  As such, we seek something akin to x = inv(A)b.  If A is a matrix, we may invert it.  If we have a time dependent problem, we essentially find this using a time integrator such as a Runge-Kutta method.<p>If the differential equation is non-linear, we have a nonlinear system of the form F(x) = b where F is a nonlinear operator.  In order to solve this, we typically apply some kind of Newton type method, which is really just truncating a Taylor series and solving for x repeatedly.  Namely, F(x+dx) ~= F(x) + F&#x27;(x)dx.  If we want F(x+dx) to be 0, we then have an iteration F&#x27;(x)dx = -F(x) where we solve for dx.  The term F&#x27;(x) is the total or Frechet derivative and is a linear operator, so we&#x27;re back to what we did before on a linear system above.  However, the question is how do we find F&#x27;(x)?  We can do this by hand, but it can be laborious and error prone to do so.  Alternatively, we can use automatic differentiation to find this operator.  One algorithm in the collection of automatic differentiation methods is the complex-step differentiation.  Other methods include things such as forward and reverse mode.<p>Outside of differential equations, optimization algorithms require the gradient and Hessian-vector product to compute effectively.  Automatic differentiation can find these quantities as well.  In fact, back propogation in machine learning is the combination of steepest descent with the reverse mode automatic differentiation algorithm.<p>Anyway, there a lot of different applications.  These are just a few.  Personally, I think there are better algorithms that the one presented in the paper, but it is important for historical purposes.<p>And, to be sure, perhaps you already know this and if so, I do apologize.  Mostly, I think there&#x27;s some confusion as to how and why we use these methods, so it helps to give some background to others who use this board as well.",[22455454],

But it is hard to believe if most of those things aren&#x27;t rediscovered in these decades. And IIRC that GCC took over partially because it was quite better. GCC &#x2F; LLVM appear to implement every new technique in someone&#x27;s PhD thesis like Diophantine equation solvers into optimization passes. I suspect it is no longer the case.<p>If you&#x27;re saying compiler itself is slow, well the rat race among compilers is producing benchmark binaries (sadly). But given how much we have advanced, I suppose fine grained incremental compilation should be norm in every compiler.<p>&gt; Turbo Pascal, too<p>Here I suppose you are talking about compile speeds. Well Turbo Pascal had the advantage that it was integrated with an IDE. Eclipse and IIRC visual studio can also reach those speeds using incremental &#x2F; background compilation.<p>&gt; We&#x27;ll probably never see the source code behind any version of the k interpreter by Arthur Whitney<p>I have heard a about this K. What is this? Is this an array programming language like APL? I would like some pointers.<p>&gt; Having portable compilers that try to heavily optimize is a mistake.
Again here there are tradeoffs. People like the comfort of portability and thus don&#x27;t care about small performance increments as long as code performs reasonably well. Although I would think we can have a peephole optimizer that can optimize based on target machine upon installation.<p>&gt; No one seems to know what a CPU cache is!<p>While this may be true for normal programmer, compiler implementers care quite a lot about caches. Especially most JIT optimizations are about cache.<p>&gt; Compiling to C &#x2F; LLVM IR doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>Sure that&#x27;s a tradeoff. But that allows to implement compilers in less time and utilize most optimizations.<p>However I too think the progress in compilers has stalled in these years. There are native programming languages being created. But it is almost Compile to C or embracing LLVM monoculture. Appreciably Go didn&#x27;t do that. And due to proliferation of scripting &#x2F; JIT languages, there&#x27;s not much scope for optimizing or fast compilers. In particular I am sceptical of LLVM monoculture. The compilers rat race prioritizing benchmarks above other things isn&#x27;t going to end well. Moreover my gut feeling is today&#x27;s compiler infrastructure is not suitable for High level languages.",,
